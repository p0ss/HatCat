Hellfire uses laser guidance and is\ndesigned to accept other guidance packages.  It is used on helicopters\nagainst heavily armored vehicles at longer standoff distances than any\nother U.S.  Army missiles now in the inventory.  The Hellfire II is the\noptimized version of the laser family of Hellfire missiles.  The Longbow\nHellfire Modular Missile System is an air-launched, radar aided,\ninertially guided missile that utilizes millimeter-wave radar technology.\nDespite the expanded acronym, most versions of the Hellfire missile are\nnot truly fire-and-forget -- all the laser-guided versions require\nconstant illumination or painting of the target from launch to impact.\nThe AGM-114L is a true fire-and-forget weapon: it requires no further\nguidance after launch and can hit its target without the launcher being in\nline of sight of the target.  The Hellfire (along with the Maverick and\nthe air-launched TOW) was to be replaced by the Joint Common Missile (JCM)\naround 2011.  The JCM was developed with a tri-mode seeker and a\nmulti-purpose warhead that would combine the capabilities of the several\nHellfire variants.  In the budget for FY2006, the US Department of Defense\ncanceled a number of projects that they felt no longer warranted\ncontinuation based on their cost effectiveness, including the JCM.  Due to\nthe U.S.  military's continuing need for a proven precision-strike\naviation weapon in the interim until a successor to the JCM is fielded, as\nwell as extensive foreign sales, it is likely the Hellfire will be in\nservice for many years.

The group includes the important\nreef builders known as hermatypic corals, found in tropical oceans, and\nbelonging to the subclass Zoantharia of order Scleractinia (formerly\nMadreporaria).  The hermatypic corals obtain much of their nutrient\nrequirement from symbiotic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae, and so\nare dependent upon growing in sunlight.  As a result, these corals are\nusually found not far beneath the surface, although in clear waters corals\ncan grow at depths of 60 m (200 ft).  Corals breed by spawning, with all\ncorals of the same species in a region releasing gametes simultaneously\nover a period of one to several nights around a full moon. (from Wikipedia)",

Most commonly, the legs or\narms are affected. Symptoms may include skin which feels tight, the\narea may feel heavy, and affected joints may be hard to move. Other\nsymptoms depend on the underlying cause. Causes may include venous\ninsufficiency, heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels,\nliver problems, deep vein thrombosis, infections, angioedema, certain\nmedications, and lymphedema. It may also occur after prolonged\nsitting or standing and during menstruation or pregnancy. The\ncondition is more concerning if it starts suddenly, or pain or\nshortness of breath is present. Treatment depends on the underlying\ncause. If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention,\ndecreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used. Elevating the\nlegs and support stockings may be useful for edema of the legs.\nOlder people are more commonly affected. [from Wikipedia]",

Except for knee,\nankle, and wrist, where the distal end has to move in the anterior\ndirection for it to be called extension.

      "sumo_definition": "Molotov cocktail, named after Vyacheslav\nMolotov, also known as petrol bomb, benzine torch, molotov grenade or\nmolotov bomb, is the generic name for a variety of crude incendiary\nweapons.  While they are commonly associated with irregular military\nforces and rioters, they are actually more frequently used for basic\narson[citation needed].  In urban slang, they are often referred to as a\nhomemade frag or the poor man's hand grenade.  A Molotov cocktail consists\nof a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid, typically petrol,\nalcohol, methanol or ethanol.  The mouth of the bottle is stopped up with\na cork or other type of airtight bung, made of rubber, glass, or plastic,\nand an igniter, such as cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth.  The\nweapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately\nprior to using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the\ntarget.  The bottle shatters on impact, spilling the flammable liquid over\nthe target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.  There are also\nsophisticated methods for igniting, such as use of pyrophoric mass Bengal\nfire or a chemical igniter based on reaction of sulfuric acid and\npotassium chlorate, which do not need an external source of fire to work.\nAdditional substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to\nenhance its use as a weapon.  Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm\nbombs in principle.  Napalm was originally made by combining flammable\nnaphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid, the latter\ntwo being the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails.  When gasoline is\nused as the main ingredient, motor oil or sugar is commonly added to help\nthe gasoline cling to the target.  (from Wikipedia)",

It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive\nblack patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The\nname 'giant panda' is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red\npanda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over\n99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild\ntubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity,\nthey may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas\nalong with specially prepared food. [Wikipedia]",

SMAW, employed by the United States Marine Corps for more than\ntwenty years, has proven performance in combat situations, easily\ndemolishing bunkers, breaching fortifications, and defeating armored\nvehicles.  The man-portable SMAW is exceedingly accurate and reliable,\nexhibiting an average hit probability greater than 90 percent on a 1 x 2\nmeter target at combat ranges.  SMAW is perfectly suited for MOUT\nscenarios, enabling the gunner to defeat enemy fortifications while\nremaining under protective cover, greatly enhancing survivability.  SMAW\nwill feature even greater capability with a new Confined Space\nfire-from-enclosure version.  Talley Defense Systems, in cooperation with\nthe US Marine Corps, is perfecting a design which drastically reduces\nbackblast and over-pressure, and virtually eliminates flash and smoke when\nfiring the weapon.  The SMAW is an 83mm man-portable weapon system\nconsisting of the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK 3 Mod 0 encased HEDP\nrocket, the MK 6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket, and the MK217 Mod 0 spotting\nrifle cartridge.  The launcher consists of a fiberglass launch tube, a 9mm\nspotting rifle, an electro-mechanical firing mechanism, open battle\nsights, and a mount for the MK42 Mod 0 optical and AN/PVS-4 night sights.\nThe SMAW MK153 Mod 0 launcher is based on the Israeli B-300 and consists\nof the launch tube, the spotting rifle, the firing mechanism, and mounting\nbrackets.  The launch tube is fiberglass/epoxy with a gel coat on the\nbore.  The spotting rifle is a British design and is mounted on the right\nside of the launch tube.  The firing mechanism mechanically fires the\nspotting rifle and uses a magneto to fire the rocket.  The mounting\nbrackets connect the components and provide the means for boresighting the\nweapon.  The encased rockets are loaded at the rear of the launcher.  The\nspotting cartridges are stored in a magazine in the cap of the encased\nrocket.  The SMAW system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was\nfielded in 1984 as a Marine Corps unique system.  At that time, the SMAW\nincluded the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK3 Mod 0 HEDP encased rocket, the\nMK4 Mod 0 practice rocket and the MK217 Mod 0 9mm spotting cartridge.  The\nMK6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket is being added to the inventory.  The MOD 0\nhas demonstrated several shortcomings.  A series of modifications is\ncurrently planned to address the deficiencies.  They include a resleeving\nprocess for bubbled launch tubes, rewriting/drafting operator and\ntechnical manuals, a kit that will reduce environmental intrusion into the\ntrigger mechanism, and an optical sight modification to allow the new HEAA\nrocket to be used effectively against moving armor targets.  Recently\nfielded were new boresight bracket kits that, when installed, will solve\nthe loss of boresight problem between launch tube and spotting rifle.\n(from http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/smaw.htm)",

The SMAW is an 83mm man-portable weapon system\nconsisting of the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK 3 Mod 0 encased HEDP\nrocket, the MK 6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket, and the MK217 Mod 0 spotting\nrifle cartridge.  The launcher consists of a fiberglass launch tube, a 9mm\nspotting rifle, an electro-mechanical firing mechanism, open battle\nsights, and a mount for the MK42 Mod 0 optical and AN/PVS-4 night sights.\nThe SMAW MK153 Mod 0 launcher is based on the Israeli B-300 and consists\nof the launch tube, the spotting rifle, the firing mechanism, and mounting\nbrackets.  The launch tube is fiberglass/epoxy with a gel coat on the\nbore.  The spotting rifle is a British design and is mounted on the right\nside of the launch tube.  The firing mechanism mechanically fires the\nspotting rifle and uses a magneto to fire the rocket.  The mounting\nbrackets connect the components and provide the means for boresighting the\nweapon.  The encased rockets are loaded at the rear of the launcher.  The\nspotting cartridges are stored in a magazine in the cap of the encased\nrocket.  The SMAW system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was\nfielded in 1984 as a Marine Corps unique system.  At that time, the SMAW\nincluded the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK3 Mod 0 HEDP encased rocket, the\nMK4 Mod 0 practice rocket and the MK217 Mod 0 9mm spotting cartridge.  The\nMK6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket is being added to the inventory.  The MOD 0\nhas demonstrated several shortcomings.  A series of modifications is\ncurrently planned to address the deficiencies.  They include a resleeving\nprocess for bubbled launch tubes, rewriting/drafting operator and\ntechnical manuals, a kit that will reduce environmental intrusion into the\ntrigger mechanism, and an optical sight modification to allow the new HEAA\nrocket to be used effectively against moving armor targets.  Recently\nfielded were new boresight bracket kits that, when installed, will solve\nthe loss of boresight problem between launch tube and spotting rifle.\n(from http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/smaw.htm)"

Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an\ninability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems\nunderstanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one\nside. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has\noccurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke\nis a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A\nhemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache.\nThe symptoms of a stroke can be permanent.
