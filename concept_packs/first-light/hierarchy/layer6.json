As opposed to the simpler\nlyre, which was a folk_instrument, the kithara was primarily used by\nprofessional musicians, called kitharodes. The kithara's origins are likely\nAsiatic. The barbiton was a bass version of the kithara popular in the eastern\nAegean and ancient Asia Minor.

The word lemur derives from the\nword lemures (ghosts or spirits) from Roman mythology and was first used to\ndescribe a slender loris due to its nocturnal habits and slow pace, but was\nlater applied to the primates on Madagascar. As with other strepsirrhine\nprimates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos (bush babies), lemurs share\nresemblance with basal primates. In this regard, lemurs are often confused with\nancestral primates, when in actuality, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and\napes, but evolved independently. [Wikipedia]",
