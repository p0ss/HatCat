  "definition": "&%InternalCombustionEngines based on the \nfour_stroke (Otto cycle) have one power stroke for every four strokes \n(up_down_up_down) and employ spark plug ignition. &%Combustion occurs \nrapidly, and during combustion the volume varies little (constant \nvolume). They are used in cars, larger boats, some motorcycles, and \nmany light aircraft. They are generally quieter, more efficient, and \nlarger than their &%TwoStrokeEngine counterparts.
