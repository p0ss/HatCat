  "definition": "Folate, also known as\nvitamin B9 and folacin, is one of the B vitamins. Manufactured\nfolic acid, which is converted into folate by the body, is used as a\ndietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable\nduring processing and storage. Folate is required for the body to\nmake DNA and RNA and metabolise amino acids necessary for cell\ndivision. As humans cannot make folate, it is required in the\ndiet, making it an essential nutrient. It occurs naturally in many\nfoods. The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S.\nis 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements. Folate in the\nform of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folate\ndeficiency. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during\npregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the\nbaby. Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the\ncause of more than half of babies born with NTDs. More than 80\ncountries use either mandatory or voluntary fortification of certain\nfoods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs.\nLong-term supplementation with relatively large amounts of folic acid\nis associated with small reduction in the risk of stroke and an\nincreased risk of prostate cancer. There are concerns that large\namounts of supplemental folic acid can hide &%VitaminB12\ndeficiency.[from Wikipedia]",
