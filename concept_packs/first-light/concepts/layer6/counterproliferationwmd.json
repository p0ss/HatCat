Major\nobjectives of CP are to prevent the acquisition of WMD and their\ndelivery systems, roll back proliferation where it has occurred, deter\nthe use of WMD and their delivery systems, and adapt US military\nforces and planning to operate against the threats posed by WMD and\ntheir delivery systems. The continued spread of WMD technology can\nfoster regional unrest and provide terrorist organizations with new\nand potent weapons. The core capabilities of CP include counterforce,\nactive defense, passive defense, and consequence management. SOF focus\non counterforce tasks and conduct CP missions as special operations by\ncovert, clandestine, or low visibility means. For more details on CP,\nsee JP 3-40, Joint Doctrine for Counterproliferation Operations.",
