  "definition": "Thiamine, also known as\nthiamin or vitamin B1, is a vitamin found in food and manufactured as\na dietary supplement and medication. Food sources of thiamine\ninclude whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish. Grain\nprocessing removes much of the thiamine content, so in many countries\ncereals and flours are enriched with thiamine. Supplements and\nmedications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and\ndisorders that result from it, including beriberi and Wernicke\nencephalopathy. Other uses include the treatment of maple syrup\nurine disease and Leigh syndrome. They are typically taken by\nmouth, but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular\ninjection.[from Wikipedia]",
