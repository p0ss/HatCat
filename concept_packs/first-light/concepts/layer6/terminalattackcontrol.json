  "definition": "These are actions to identify\nand precisely report the location of targets, and with global\npositioning systems, laser designators, beacons, or other means,\nconduct either terminal attack control (TAC) or terminal guidance\noperations (TGO) to effectively engage them. TAC involves actions to\ncontrol the maneuver of and grant weapons release clearance to\nattacking aircraft. TGO includes any electronic, mechanical, voice or\nvisual communication that provides approaching aircraft or weapons\nadditional information regarding a specific location or target. TAC\ndiffers from TGO in that TAC includes the authority to clear aircraft\nto release ordnance and TGO does not. Because of this, TAC requires\nindividuals to be qualified as joint terminal attack controllers, but\nTGO does not.",
