  "definition": "Castanets are a percussion instrument\n(idiophone), used in Kalo, Moorish, Ottoman, ancient Roman, Italian, Spanish,\nSephardic, Swiss, and Portuguese music. The instrument consists of a pair of\nconcave shells joined on one edge by a string. They are held in the hand and\nused to produce clicks for rhythmic accents or a ripping or rattling sound\nconsisting of a rapid series of clicks. They are traditionally made of hardwood\n(chestnut; Spanish: casta\u00f1o), although fibreglass is becoming increasingly\npopular.[from Wikipedia]",
