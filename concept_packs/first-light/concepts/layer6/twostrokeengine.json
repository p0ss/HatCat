  "definition": "Engines based on the \ntwo_stroke cycle use two strokes (one up, one down) for every power \nstroke. Since there are no dedicated intake or exhaust strokes, \nalternative methods must be used to scavenge the cylinders. The most \ncommon method in spark_ignition two_strokes is to use the downward \nmotion of the piston to pressurize fresh charge in the &%Crankcase, \nwhich is then blown through the &%Cylinder through ports in the \ncylinder walls.
