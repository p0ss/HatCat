  "definition": "Pantothenic acid, also\ncalled vitamin B5 is a water-soluble B vitamin and therefore an\nessential nutrient. All animals require pantothenic acid in order\nto synthesize coenzyme A (CoA) \u2013 essential for fatty acid metabolism \u2013\nas well as to, in general, synthesize and metabolize proteins,\ncarbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the combination of\npantoic acid and \u03b2-alanine. Its name derives from the Greek pantos,\nmeaning 'from everywhere', as minimally, at least small quantities of\npantothenic acid are found in nearly every food. Human\ndeficiency is very rare. As a dietary supplement or animal feed\ningredient, the form commonly used is calcium pantothenate because of\nchemical stability, and hence long product shelf life, compared to\nsodium pantothenate or free pantothenic acid.[from Wikipedia]",
