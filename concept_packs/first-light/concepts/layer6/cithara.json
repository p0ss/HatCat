  "definition": "Cithara was an ancient Greek musical\ninstrument in the lyre or lyra family. In modern Greek the word kithara has come\nto mean 'guitar', a word which etymologically stems from kithara. The kithara\nwas a professional version of the two_stringed lyre. As opposed to the simpler\nlyre, which was a folk_instrument, the kithara was primarily used by\nprofessional musicians, called kitharodes. The kithara's origins are likely\nAsiatic. The barbiton was a bass version of the kithara popular in the eastern\nAegean and ancient Asia Minor. In the Middle Ages, cythara was also used\ngenerically for stringed instruments including lyres, but also including\nlute_like instruments.[4][5] The use of the name throughout the Middle Ages\nlooked back to the original Greek cithara and its abilities to sway people's\nemotions.
