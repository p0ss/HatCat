  "definition": "The AGM-65 Maverick is an air-to-surface tactical\nmissile (ASM) designed for close air support, prohibition, and forceful\nprevention.  It is effective against a wide range of tactical targets,\nincluding armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation, and fuel\nstorage facilities.  The AGM-65F (infrared targeting) used by the US Navy\nhas an infrared guidance system optimized for ship tracking and a larger\npenetrating warhead than the shaped charge used by the US Marine Corps and\nthe US Air Force (300 pounds (136 kg) vs 125 pounds (57 kg)).  The AGM-65\nhas two types of warheads, one has a contact fuze in the nose, and the\nother has a heavyweight warhead with a delayed fuze, which penetrates the\ntarget with its kinetic energy before firing.  The latter is most\neffective against large, hard targets.  The propulsion system for both\ntypes is a solid-fuel rocket motor behind the warhead.  (from Wikipedia)",
