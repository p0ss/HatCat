  "definition": "Niacin, also known as\nnicotinic acid, is an organic compound and a form of vitamin B3, an\nessential human nutrient. It can be manufactured by plants and\nanimals from the amino acid tryptophan. Niacin is obtained in the\ndiet from a variety of whole and processed foods, with highest\ncontents in fortified packaged foods, meat, poultry, red fish such as\ntuna and salmon, lesser amounts in nuts, legumes and seeds.\nNiacin as a dietary supplement is used to treat pellagra, a disease\ncaused by niacin deficiency. Signs and symptoms of pellagra include\nskin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Many\ncountries mandate its addition to wheat flour or other food grains,\nthereby reducing the risk of pellagra.[from Wikipedia]",
