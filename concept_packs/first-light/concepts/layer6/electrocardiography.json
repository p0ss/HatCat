  "definition": "Electrocardiography is the process of producing a graph of voltage\nversus time of the electrical activity of the &%Heart using\nelectrodes placed on the &%Skin. These electrodes detect the small\nelectrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle\ndepolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle\n(heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous\ncardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as\natrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate\ncoronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and\nmyocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as\nhypokalemia and hyperkalemia). In a conventional 12-lead ECG,\nten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of\nthe chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential\nis then measured from twelve different angles ('leads') and is\nrecorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the\noverall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical\ndepolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac\ncycle.[from Wikipedia].",
