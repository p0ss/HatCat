  "definition": "This appraisal category\nstands alone: appraisal of loss is not a continuum like the others\n(pleasant---unpleasant; expected---unexpected). Rather it is quite\ndiscrete, loss or no loss, and is better defined by WHAT has been lost,\nor at least, in which relation the thing that has been lost stands to\nthe person experiencing the emotion. Loss of a loved person, loss of the\nexpectation of achieving a hoped for life goal, and loss of a limb are\nall kinds of loss. While it is tempting not to categorise this as an\nappraisal at all, it should be noted that the loss does not actually\nhave to occur -- it only has to be believed, judged, or (in other words)\nappraised to have occurred -- for the emotion to take place.",
