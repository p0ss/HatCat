  "definition": "The M242 Bushmaster is a 25 mm chain gun.  It is\ncurrently used by the US Armed Forces and other NATO forces.  It is used\nextensively on vehicles and aircraft.  It is an externally powered, chain\ndriven, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic or\nautomatic modes.  It is fed by a metallic link belt and has dual-feed\ncapability.  The term chain gun derives from the use of a roller chain\nthat drives the bolt back and forth.  It can destroy lightly armored\nvehicles and aerial targets (such as helicopters and slow-flying\naircraft).  It can also suppress enemy positions such as troops in the\nopen, dug-in positions, and built-up areas.  The standard rate of fire is\n200 rounds per minute, and has a range of 2,000 meters (depending on the\ntype of ammunition used).  (from Wikipedia)",
