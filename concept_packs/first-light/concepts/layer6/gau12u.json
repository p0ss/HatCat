  "definition": "The five-barrel 'Equalizer' cannon was developed in\nthe late 1970s, based on the mechanism of the GAU-8/A Avenger cannon, but\nfiring a new NATO series of 25 mm ammunition.  The GAU-12U cannon is\noperated by a 15 hp (11 kW) electric motor, in external mounts supplied by\na bleed air-drive pneumatic system.  Its rate of fire is normally 3,600\nrounds per minute, with a maximum of 4,200 rounds per minute.  The\nEqualizer normally uses PGU-20/U armor-piercing incendiary (API) or PGU-22\nor PGU-25 high-explosive incendiary (HEI) ammunition.  With a\nharder-hitting projectile and comparable muzzle velocity, it is more\nlethal than the older M61 Vulcan, and more effective than the older 30 mm\nADEN cannon it replaces.  (from Wikipedia)",
