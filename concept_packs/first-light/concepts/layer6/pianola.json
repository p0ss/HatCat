  "definition": "A player piano (also known as pianola)\nis a self_playing piano, containing a pneumatic or electro_mechanical mechanism\nthat operates the piano action via pre_programmed music recorded on perforated\npaper, or in rare instances, metallic rolls, with more modern implementations\nusing MIDI. The rise of the player piano grew with the rise of the mass_produced\npiano for the home in the late 19th and early 20th century. Sales peaked in\n1924, then declined as the improvement in phonograph recordings due to\nelectrical recording methods developed in the mid-1920s. The advent of\nelectrical amplification in home music reproduction via radio in the same period\nhelped cause their eventual decline in popularity, and the stock market crash of\n1929 virtually wiped out production.[from Wikipedia]",
