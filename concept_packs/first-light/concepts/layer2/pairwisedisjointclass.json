  "opposite_reasoning": "PairwiseDisjointClass is a highly technical mathematical/logical concept describing class structure where instances are mutually exclusive. The strongest opposite is OverlappingClass, representing a class structure where instances share members or overlap in their extensions. This provides: (1) Clear mathematical opposition based on set-theoretic properties (disjoint vs. overlapping), (2) Complementary rather than merely different concepts, (3) Useful for concept steering in distinguishing rigid categorical boundaries from fuzzy or overlapping categories. While this concept likely doesn't exist in standard WordNet or SUMO, it represents a legitimate ontological concept that should be added for completeness. The opposition is strong enough to be useful for Fisher-LDA dimensionality reduction."
