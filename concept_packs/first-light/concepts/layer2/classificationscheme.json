  "opposite_reasoning": "Chaos provides the strongest semantic opposition to ClassificationScheme along the critical order/structure dimension. ClassificationScheme embodies systematic organization, hierarchical structure, and intentional arrangement of concepts - Chaos represents the complete absence of these properties. This opposition is conceptually clean, widely understood, exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and creates a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA (structured\u2194chaotic). For AI safety applications, this axis could help distinguish between systematic reasoning/organization versus disordered thinking patterns. The opposition strength is high (9/10) with good confidence (8/10)."
