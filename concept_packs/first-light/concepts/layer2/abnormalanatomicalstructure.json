  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the most natural and semantically coherent opposite for AbnormalAnatomicalStructure. It forms a clear binary opposition within the medical/anatomical domain (abnormal vs. normal), which is ideal for Fisher-LDA concept axes. While not directly relevant to AI safety deception detection, it provides the strongest semantic opposition for this specialized medical concept. The abnormal-normal axis is fundamental in medical ontologies and should provide clear separation in embedding space."
