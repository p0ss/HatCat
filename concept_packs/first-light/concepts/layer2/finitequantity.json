  "opposite_reasoning": "InfiniteQuantity is the canonical opposite of FiniteQuantity in both logical and mathematical frameworks. The opposition is binary, clear, and well-established in ontological systems. While the steering utility for AI safety applications (deception detection) is moderate rather than high, this is appropriate given that FiniteQuantity is a foundational quantitative attribute rather than a behavioral or ethical concept. The finite/infinite distinction is fundamental across domains (mathematics, physics, philosophy) and provides maximum opposition strength (10/10) for Fisher-LDA centroid separation. SUMO ontology very likely includes this concept given its standard treatment of quantity hierarchies."
