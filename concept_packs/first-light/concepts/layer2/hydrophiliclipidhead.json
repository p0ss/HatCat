  "opposite_reasoning": "HydrophobicLipidTail is the ideal semantic opposite because: (1) It represents the complementary part of lipid molecular structure - heads are hydrophilic, tails are hydrophobic; (2) It maintains structural parallelism at the same ontological level (both are molecular components); (3) The opposition is based on the fundamental binary property of water interaction (philic vs phobic); (4) This is a well-established biochemical pairing that would create the strongest Fisher-LDA axis for distinguishing these concepts. While steering utility for AI safety is moderate (this is a domain-specific biochemistry concept), the opposition strength is maximal for the technical domain."
