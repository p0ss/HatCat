  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest complementary opposition to SocialOrgs by capturing the collective\u2194singular dimension. This opposition is fundamental to understanding social organization: SocialOrgs represent groups with coordinated structure, while Individual represents autonomous single agents. For AI safety applications, this axis is valuable for: (1) distinguishing organizational-level deception from individual deception, (2) understanding collective action vs individual agency, (3) monitoring how AI systems model group behavior vs individual behavior. The concept almost certainly exists in both WordNet and SUMO as a fundamental ontological category, making it highly available. While not a strict antonym, it represents the natural complement in the domain of agents/entities."
