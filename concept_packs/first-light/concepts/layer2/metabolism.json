  "definition": "Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining\nchemical reactions in organisms. The three main purposes of metabolism\nare: the conversion of the energy in food to energy available to run\ncellular processes; the conversion of food to building blocks for\n&%Proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some &%Carbohydrates; and the\nelimination of metabolic wastes. These &%Enzyme -catalyzed reactions\nallow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and\nrespond to their environments.[from Wikipedia]",

  "opposite_reasoning": "Death provides the strongest semantic opposition to Metabolism for Fisher-LDA steering. Metabolism encompasses life-sustaining processes, while Death represents the complete cessation of these processes. This pairing offers: (1) Clear biological opposition - metabolism maintains life, death ends it; (2) Strong conceptual distance that should create effective separation in embedding space; (3) High availability in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies; (4) Intuitive interpretability for the concept axis. While Stasis is also a strong candidate, Death provides a more absolute and well-defined opposing anchor. The main limitation is that Death is more of an end-state than a continuous opposing process, but this still provides valuable contrast for identifying metabolic vs. non-metabolic concepts."
