  "opposite_reasoning": "Independence is the strongest semantic opposite for EntanglementRelation. It directly negates all core properties: where entanglement implies non-separable correlation and dependent properties, independence implies separable, uncorrelated states with independently definable properties. For AI safety monitoring, the Independence\u2194Entanglement axis is highly valuable for detecting hidden couplings in reasoning, tool binding issues, and concept conflation. Independence is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making it readily available. The conceptual clarity and direct opposition make it ideal for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring."
