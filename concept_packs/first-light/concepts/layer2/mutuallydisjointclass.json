  "opposite_reasoning": "OverlappingClass provides the strongest logical opposition to MutuallyDisjointClass. The defining property of MutuallyDisjointClass is that \u2203x: \u2200C\u2208S \u2192 \u00ac(x\u2208C) (no instance belongs to all member classes). OverlappingClass would capture the negation: \u2203x: x\u2208C\u2081 \u2227 x\u2208C\u2082 for some pair of classes (instances share membership). This binary opposition (overlap vs. no overlap) creates a clean semantic axis for Fisher-LDA. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between disjoint categorizations and overlapping/ambiguous categorizations could be relevant for detecting category confusion or conceptual blending in AI reasoning."
