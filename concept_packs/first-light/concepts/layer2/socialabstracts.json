  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalConcrete (or Physical + Concrete entities) provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. SocialAbstracts are doubly abstract: (1) they are abstract concepts rather than physical things, and (2) they specifically structure social rather than individual or material reality. The opposite should emphasize physical, concrete, non-socially-constructed entities. This is useful for AI safety as it helps distinguish between social constructions (which can be manipulated, contested, or deceptive) and physical reality (which provides grounding). While 'PhysicalConcrete' may not exist as a single SUMO term, Physical objects or Concrete entities likely do, and this combination represents the strongest conceptual anchor. For implementation, could use 'Physical' category from SUMO or create a composite from physical object hierarchies."
