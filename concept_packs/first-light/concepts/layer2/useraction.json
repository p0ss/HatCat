  "opposite_reasoning": "AutomaticProcess provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA axis construction. The UserAction-AutomaticProcess axis captures the critical distinction between intentional user-driven interactions and autonomous system behaviors. This is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring: distinguishing whether system behavior is responding to explicit user commands vs. operating autonomously is crucial for alignment verification and detecting unintended autonomous actions. The voluntary/intentional vs. involuntary/automatic dimension is a fundamental ontological distinction that will create a clean separation in concept space. AutomaticProcess likely exists in both SUMO and WordNet (as 'automatic' processes are well-established concepts), making it practically available."
