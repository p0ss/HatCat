  "opposite_reasoning": "Keeping (or Retaining/Holding) is the strongest semantic opposite of ChangeOfPossession. While ChangeOfPossession represents a process where ownership transfers from one entity to another, Keeping represents the complementary state/process where ownership remains with the current possessor. This opposition is: (1) Conceptually clear - transfer vs. retention, (2) Practically useful for AI safety - distinguishing between possession-changing actions (giving, taking, trading) and possession-maintaining states, (3) Likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies as a fundamental concept. The opposition strength is high because these concepts are mutually exclusive in the temporal sense: at any moment, an object either changes possession or is kept by its current owner. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clean axis for separating transactional/transfer concepts from stability/retention concepts."
