  "opposite_reasoning": "InorganicMatter provides the strongest semantic opposition to OrgansAndSystems. It captures multiple dimensions of opposition: (1) organic vs inorganic chemistry, (2) living vs non-living, (3) biologically organized vs unorganized, and (4) functional biological structures vs non-functional matter. This opposition is well-established in SUMO ontology and provides clear distributional separation for Fisher-LDA. The animate/inanimate distinction is fundamental and will create strong centroid separation for concept steering."
