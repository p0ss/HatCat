  "opposite_reasoning": "Abstract is the strongest semantic opposite for PhysicalGeography because it captures the fundamental ontological distinction between physical and non-physical entities. PhysicalGeography encompasses tangible, spatial features of the natural world (mountains, rivers, continents), while Abstract encompasses intangible, non-spatial concepts (ideas, propositions, qualities). This opposition: (1) Has maximum semantic distance in ontological space, (2) Is well-established in SUMO's upper ontology, (3) Creates a clear and useful Fisher-LDA axis for distinguishing physical from conceptual content. While it has moderate steering utility for AI safety (not directly related to deception/alignment), it provides a robust foundational axis for understanding how models represent physical vs. abstract concepts."
