  "opposite_reasoning": "AirQuality is the best semantic opposite for AirPollution because: (1) it represents the complementary state on the atmospheric condition spectrum, (2) it's a well-established concept in both environmental science and common usage, (3) it provides strong opposition for Fisher-LDA (clean vs polluted air forms a natural axis), (4) it likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and (5) it's highly relevant for AI safety monitoring of environmental concepts. The term is commonly used in regulatory contexts (Air Quality Index) and represents measurable positive attributes that directly oppose pollution."
