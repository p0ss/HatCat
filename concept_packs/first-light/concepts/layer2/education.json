  "opposite_reasoning": "Ignorance provides the strongest and most fundamental semantic opposition to Education. While Education is a process category, it exists to combat and reduce ignorance (a state). This state-process opposition is well-suited for Fisher-LDA because: (1) it captures the core purpose and outcome of education, (2) it has strong availability in both WordNet and SUMO, (3) it provides clear distributional separation in semantic space, and (4) while Miseducation scores higher on safety utility, Ignorance offers more stable and broadly applicable opposition. For AI safety applications, distinguishing educational content from ignorance-perpetuating content is fundamental to detecting misinformation and knowledge manipulation."
