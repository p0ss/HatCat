  "opposite_reasoning": "Host is the strongest semantic opposite for Parasite. They form a natural complementary pair in biological and ecological contexts - parasites cannot exist without hosts, and the relationship is definitionally antagonistic. This opposition is well-established in scientific literature, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides clear conceptual separation for Fisher-LDA. The pairing also has metaphorical utility for AI safety contexts (e.g., exploitative vs. supportive relationships, dependency vs. autonomy). Host should definitely be included in the same layer structure as Parasite for balanced concept representation."
