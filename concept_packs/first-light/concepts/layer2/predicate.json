  "definition": "A &%Predicate is a sentence-forming &%Relation.\nEach tuple in the &%Relation is a finite, ordered sequence of objects.\nThe fact that a particular tuple is an element of a &%Predicate is denoted\nby '(*predicate* arg_1 arg_2 .. arg_n)', where the arg_i are the\nobjects so related.  In the case of &%BinaryPredicates, the fact can\nbe read as `arg_1 is *predicate* arg_2' or `a *predicate* of\narg_1 is arg_2'.",

  "opposite_reasoning": "Object provides the strongest category-level opposition to Predicate within SUMO's ontological framework. The Predicate/Object distinction captures the fundamental difference between 'relations that connect' and 'entities that are connected' - analogous to verbs vs nouns in language. This is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring because distinguishing between relational claims (predicates) and entity references (objects) is crucial for understanding propositional content and potential deception. Object is definitively in both SUMO and WordNet, making it immediately available. While Predicate has no direct antonym in the traditional sense, this category-level opposition provides the most semantically meaningful and technically useful contrast for Fisher-LDA concept axes."
