  "opposite_reasoning": "Inattention is the most direct and semantically clear opposite of Attention. It represents the lack or absence of attentional mechanisms - the natural negation on the attention spectrum. This opposition is highly useful for Fisher-LDA as it provides maximum separation: focused mental resource allocation (Attention) vs. lack of such allocation (Inattention). For AI safety monitoring, this axis helps distinguish between systems that are actively tracking and processing targets vs. those that are unfocused or failing to allocate cognitive resources appropriately. While Inattention may not exist in the current SUMO ontology, it is a standard psychological term found in WordNet and should be added to create a complete conceptual axis."
