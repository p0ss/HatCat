  "opposite_reasoning": "SoftwareUninstallation is the strongest complementary opposite to SoftwareInstallation. These represent inverse lifecycle operations in software management: installation adds/deploys software while uninstallation removes it. They are mutually exclusive, temporally ordered opposites that form a natural process pair. This opposition provides clear semantic distance for Fisher-LDA axes and is conceptually clean. While not directly relevant to deception/alignment monitoring, it provides a strong baseline for understanding software lifecycle processes, which could be relevant for detecting unauthorized software modifications or deployment anomalies in AI systems."
