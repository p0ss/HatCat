  "opposite_reasoning": "Abundance provides the strongest semantic opposition to Famine on the most relevant dimension: scarcity vs. plenty. While Famine specifically refers to food scarcity leading to starvation and death, Abundance captures the opposite state of plentiful resources and supply. This opposition is conceptually clean, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides good steering utility for Fisher-LDA by anchoring opposite ends of a resource-availability spectrum. Prosperity is close but more abstract/economic; Feast is too specific to eating events rather than the broader catastrophic shortage state."
