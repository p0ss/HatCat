  "opposite_reasoning": "SpaceMeasure provides the strongest conceptual opposition to TimeMeasure based on fundamental physics and ontology. Time and space form complementary dimensions of reality - this is a well-established philosophical and scientific distinction. The opposition is clean (temporal vs spatial measurement), symmetric, and both concepts are likely to exist in standard ontologies. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis separating temporal concepts from spatial concepts, which is semantically meaningful and stable. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it provides robust dimensional separation for general concept steering."
