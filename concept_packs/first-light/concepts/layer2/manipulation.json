  "opposite_reasoning": "Transparency is the strongest opposite for Manipulation in AI safety contexts. It captures: (1) opposition to strategic information shaping, (2) contrast with ambiguity and frame manipulation, (3) clear relevance to detecting deceptive vs. honest AI behavior, (4) comprehensive coverage of manipulation's child concepts (algorithmic laundering \u2192 transparent algorithms, strategic ambiguity \u2192 clear communication). While it may need to be added to layers, it's the most semantically powerful and practically useful anchor for Fisher-LDA steering away from manipulative behaviors."
