  "opposite_reasoning": "Working is the strongest opposite for WorkLeave because: (1) The definition of WorkLeave explicitly references it as 'leave FROM Working', establishing a direct complementary relationship; (2) They are mutually exclusive states - one cannot simultaneously be working and on work leave; (3) Working is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO with high availability; (4) For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum semantic distance on the employment activity axis; (5) The opposition is clear, unambiguous, and captures the core distinction. While OnDuty or ActiveEmployment might be more precise, Working has the advantage of definitional grounding and guaranteed availability."
