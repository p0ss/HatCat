  "opposite_reasoning": "GenericProduct provides the strongest semantic opposition to Brand within the commercial/product domain. Brand represents differentiation through naming and identity, while generic products explicitly lack this branded identity. This opposition is meaningful for Fisher-LDA as it captures a clear conceptual axis: branded/differentiated vs. unbranded/undifferentiated. While not a classic antonym, this complementary relationship is stronger than abstract category opposites (like Process or PhysicalObject) because it maintains domain coherence while maximizing semantic distance. For AI safety applications, distinguishing branded identity from generic/anonymous concepts could be relevant for understanding attribution, authenticity, and identity claims."
