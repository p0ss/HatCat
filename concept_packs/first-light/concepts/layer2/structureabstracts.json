  "opposite_reasoning": "While StructureAbstracts doesn't have a direct antonym, PhysicalObject provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. It represents the classic abstract\u2194physical divide in ontology, has excellent availability (exists in both WordNet and SUMO), and provides clear semantic separation. For AI safety applications, distinguishing abstract organizational frameworks from concrete physical entities is meaningful - it helps models differentiate between conceptual structures (like propaganda frames, memes, narratives) and tangible objects. IndependentPrimitive would be theoretically stronger but has lower availability and may not exist in standard ontologies. PhysicalObject is the safest, most reliable choice with strong semantic distance."
