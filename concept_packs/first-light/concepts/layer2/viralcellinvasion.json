  "opposite_reasoning": "ViralCellExit represents the strongest semantic opposition as the complementary process in the viral lifecycle - the directional inverse of invasion. While it may not exist in current ontologies, it provides the clearest conceptual anchor for Fisher-LDA: invasion (penetration inward) vs exit (release outward). This captures the essential directional and temporal opposition. If unavailable, CellularDefense is the best fallback as it represents the functional antagonist to viral invasion and likely exists in SUMO's biological process hierarchy."
