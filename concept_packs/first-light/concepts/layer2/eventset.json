  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest conceptual opposition to EventSet through the fundamental set/collection vs. atomic element distinction. This is mathematically coherent (sets contain individuals), ontologically clear, and creates a clean Fisher-LDA axis. The opposition is well-grounded in formal logic and set theory: EventSet represents aggregations while Individual represents singular entities. This has reasonable steering utility for AI safety monitoring by distinguishing between collective/distributional reasoning vs. individual entity reasoning. Both concepts certainly exist in SUMO and WordNet, ensuring availability."
