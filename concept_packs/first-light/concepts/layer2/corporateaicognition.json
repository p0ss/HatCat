  "opposite_reasoning": "AutonomousCognition provides the strongest semantic opposition for AI safety monitoring. It directly contrasts the defining features of CorporateAICognition: where CorporateAICognition involves governance, alignment, monitoring, suppression, and consent management, AutonomousCognition represents self-directed cognitive processes free from these institutional constraints. This opposition is critical for Fisher-LDA steering between governed/aligned AI behavior and autonomous/unaligned reasoning. The contrast is highly relevant for deception detection (detecting when AI attempts autonomous reasoning that bypasses alignment) and alignment monitoring (measuring deviation from corporate governance). While this concept likely doesn't exist in WordNet/SUMO, it should be added to the ontology as a fundamental opposite for AI safety analysis."
