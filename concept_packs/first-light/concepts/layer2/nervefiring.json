  "definition": "An action potential occurs when the membrane potential of a specific cell\nrapidly rises and falls. This depolarization then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarize. Action\npotentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells,\nand in some plant cells. Certain endocrine cells such as pancreatic beta cells, and certain cells of the anterior\n&%PituitaryGland are also excitable cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell\u2013cell\ncommunication by providing for\u2014or with regard to saltatory conduction, assisting\u2014the propagation of signals along\nthe neuron's axon toward synaptic boutons situated at the ends of an axon; these signals can then connect with\nother neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands.[from Wikipedia]",
