  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest conceptual anchor for Fisher-LDA opposition. OrganizationalBoard represents collective, hierarchical, institutional decision-making while Individual represents autonomous, singular agency. This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring as it helps distinguish between collective institutional behavior vs. individual action - critical for understanding agency attribution, responsibility, and decision-making contexts. Individual is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available. The collective\u2194individual axis is fundamental to social ontology and provides clear semantic separation."
