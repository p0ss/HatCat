  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest semantic opposition for OrganizationalUnit with high utility for AI safety monitoring. The collective\u2194individual dimension is fundamental for: (1) responsibility attribution in AI systems, (2) distinguishing between institutional and personal agency, (3) detecting deceptive deflection between organizational and individual accountability, (4) monitoring whether AI attributes decisions to diffuse groups vs. specific actors. This opposition is well-established in both SUMO and WordNet, and creates a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA separation. The complementary nature (mutually exclusive but exhaustive for social agents) makes it ideal for concept steering."
