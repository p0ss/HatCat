  "opposite_reasoning": "StationaryStructure (or FixedStructure/PermanentStructure) provides the strongest opposition by directly negating the defining characteristic of MobileStructure: mobility. This creates a clear complementary binary along the mobility dimension - structures that can be moved vs structures that are fixed in place. This opposition is: (1) semantically coherent and maximizes distance for Fisher-LDA, (2) maintains the same category level (both are types of structures), (3) likely to be well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and (4) creates intuitive concept axes useful for distinguishing temporary/mobile vs permanent/fixed infrastructure."
