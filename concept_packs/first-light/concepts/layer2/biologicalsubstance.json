  "opposite_reasoning": "SyntheticSubstance provides the strongest semantic opposition to BiologicalSubstance within the same ontological level (both are substance types). This opposition captures the fundamental distinction between naturally-occurring biological materials and artificially-created substances, which is maximally useful for Fisher-LDA because it creates a clear conceptual axis within the domain of substances. The biological vs. synthetic distinction is well-established in chemistry, materials science, and ontology frameworks, making it the most coherent choice for a negative centroid anchor."
