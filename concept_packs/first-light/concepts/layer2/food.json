  "opposite_reasoning": "Poison provides the strongest semantic opposition to Food because it captures the essential functional distinction: life-sustaining vs. life-threatening ingestible substances. This opposition is conceptually clear, has strong cultural/linguistic support, and would create a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA. While Food doesn't have a traditional antonym, Poison represents its functional inverse in terms of biological effect. This pairing would be useful for AI safety in distinguishing beneficial from harmful substances, and could extend metaphorically to beneficial vs. harmful information/content."
