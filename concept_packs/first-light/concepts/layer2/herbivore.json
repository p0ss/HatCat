  "opposite_reasoning": "Carnivore is the strongest semantic opposite for Herbivore. They represent complementary categories in the biological classification of feeding behavior, with clear mutual exclusivity (an animal cannot be both strictly carnivorous and herbivorous). This opposition is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making it highly available. The contrast creates a natural axis for Fisher-LDA: herbivore-related concepts (plant-eating, grazing, prey animals) vs carnivore-related concepts (meat-eating, hunting, predation). While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (this is primarily a biological distinction rather than behavioral/ethical), it's still useful for understanding conceptual categorization and could have applications in broader reasoning about categories, mutual exclusivity, and taxonomic relationships."
