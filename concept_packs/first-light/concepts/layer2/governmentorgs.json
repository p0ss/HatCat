  "opposite_reasoning": "PrivateOrganization provides the strongest complementary opposition to GovernmentOrgs along the public/private institutional dimension. This pairing is semantically clean: government organizations are publicly authorized and serve regulatory/official functions, while private organizations operate independently in the private sector. For AI safety monitoring, this distinction is valuable for detecting institutional framing, authority claims, and organizational context. The opposition is mutually exclusive at the categorical level (an organization is either governmental or private) while maintaining the same level of organizational abstraction. Both concepts are well-established in ontologies and have clear, non-overlapping membership criteria."
