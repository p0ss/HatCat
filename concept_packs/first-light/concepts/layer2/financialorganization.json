  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest and most coherent opposition for FinancialOrganization. The opposition captures a fundamental ontological distinction: collective institutional entities vs singular human entities. This is particularly useful for Fisher-LDA steering because: (1) it cleanly separates organizational/institutional concepts from individual/personal concepts, (2) it's well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO, (3) it has practical utility for AI safety in distinguishing between organizational behavior/responsibility and individual agency/action, and (4) the opposition is intuitive and semantically meaningful. While FinancialOrganization lacks a true antonym, Individual represents the most coherent negative anchor on the collective-individual dimension."
