  "opposite_reasoning": "Dispersing is the strongest semantic opposite for Swarming. It captures the inverse collective movement pattern: while swarming involves large numbers moving together/converging, dispersing involves large numbers moving apart/scattering. Both are processes involving collective movement, but in opposite directions relative to concentration. This opposition is highly intuitive, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides clear semantic distance for Fisher-LDA axis construction. For AI safety steering, this axis could help distinguish between collective convergent behaviors vs. collective divergent behaviors, which may be relevant for understanding coordination patterns."
