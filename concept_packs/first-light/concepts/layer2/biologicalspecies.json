  "opposite_reasoning": "AbstractEntity (or 'Abstract' in SUMO) provides the strongest semantic opposition for BiologicalSpecies. The opposition captures the fundamental divide between concrete biological entities with physical instantiation, reproduction capabilities, and genetic inheritance versus non-physical conceptual entities. This opposition is: (1) ontologically clean - abstract entities cannot be biological species and vice versa, (2) maximally distant in semantic space while remaining meaningful, (3) well-established in SUMO's upper ontology, and (4) useful for Fisher-LDA as it captures physical vs. non-physical dimensions. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between reasoning about concrete biological entities versus abstract concepts, which may be relevant for grounding and factuality assessment."
