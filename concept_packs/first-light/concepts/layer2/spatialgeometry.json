  "opposite_reasoning": "TemporalRelation provides the strongest conceptual opposition to SpatialGeometry through the fundamental space-time dichotomy. This is a well-established ontological distinction: spatial properties (position, shape, dimension) vs. temporal properties (duration, sequence, simultaneity). Both concepts are abstract, mathematical, and structural, making them comparable in type while maximally distant in domain. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis separating spatial reasoning from temporal reasoning. High availability in both WordNet and SUMO ensures practical utility. While not directly relevant to deception detection, this axis could help distinguish different reasoning modalities in AI systems."
