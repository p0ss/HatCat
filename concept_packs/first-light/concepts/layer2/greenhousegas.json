  "opposite_reasoning": "InertGas provides the best balance of opposition strength and availability. While CoolingGas would be the strongest functional opposite (warming vs cooling effect), it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies. InertGas exists in both WordNet and SUMO, represents gases that do NOT interact with infrared radiation (the key defining property), and provides clear semantic distance. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful axis: gases that affect climate through radiation absorption vs gases that are radiatively inactive. The distinction is scientifically valid and provides useful separation in concept space."
