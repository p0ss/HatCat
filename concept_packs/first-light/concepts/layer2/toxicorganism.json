  "opposite_reasoning": "BeneficialOrganism provides the strongest semantic opposition by contrasting harm with benefit rather than just absence of harm. This creates a more informative Fisher-LDA axis: toxic/harmful \u2194 beneficial/helpful. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is particularly valuable as it captures the positive/negative impact dimension relevant to alignment. While this concept may not exist in current ontologies, it represents a principled opposition worth adding to the layer system. The harm/benefit axis is fundamental to safety evaluation."
