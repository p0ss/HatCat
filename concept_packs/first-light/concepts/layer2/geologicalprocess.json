  "opposite_reasoning": "IntentionalProcess provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering because it captures the fundamental natural/automatic vs intentional/goal-directed dimension. This is highly relevant for AI safety applications: distinguishing between emergent/automatic behaviors and deliberate/purposeful actions is crucial for alignment monitoring. GeologicalProcess exemplifies natural, non-agentic phenomena, while IntentionalProcess represents purposeful, agent-driven activities. This axis could help detect whether AI systems are operating in automatic modes vs engaging in deliberate, potentially deceptive planning. While BiologicalProcess is a cleaner taxonomic complement, IntentionalProcess offers better utility for safety-critical concept steering."
