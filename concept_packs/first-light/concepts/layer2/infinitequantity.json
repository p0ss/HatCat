  "opposite_reasoning": "FiniteQuantity is the strongest and most natural opposite to InfiniteQuantity. It represents a perfect binary opposition: finite vs infinite, bounded vs unbounded, limited vs unlimited. This is a fundamental mathematical and philosophical distinction that exists across multiple domains. The term appears in WordNet (finite_quantity.n.01) and is likely in SUMO as it's a core ontological concept. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separation along the dimension of magnitude boundedness. While the steering utility for AI safety may not be immediately obvious, understanding quantity boundaries is relevant for resource reasoning, constraints, and detecting unrealistic/unbounded claims in AI outputs."
