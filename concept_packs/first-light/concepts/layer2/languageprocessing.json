  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalProcess provides the cleanest and most useful opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. LanguageProcessing operates in the cognitive/symbolic domain (comprehending, generating, transforming meanings), while PhysicalProcess operates in the material domain (state changes, movements, transformations of physical entities). This cognitive\u2194physical axis is: (1) Strong semantic opposition (8/10) - clear boundary between symbolic and material operations, (2) High availability (10/10) - PhysicalProcess is a fundamental SUMO category, (3) Good steering utility (7/10) - helps AI systems distinguish between abstract reasoning about language vs physical world operations, relevant for grounding and embodiment. (4) High confidence (9/10) - well-defined ontological categories. The axis captures whether an AI is engaging in symbolic/linguistic reasoning versus physical world modeling."
