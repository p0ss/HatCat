  "opposite_reasoning": "SoftwareInstallation is the optimal opposite for SoftwareUnInstallation. These are perfect binary procedural antonyms - one adds software to a system, the other removes it. They represent inverse operations in the software lifecycle with maximum semantic opposition strength (10/10). Both concepts are well-established in computing ontologies and WordNet. For Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring, this pairing provides the clearest conceptual axis: adding software components vs removing software components. While this specific pairing may have limited direct utility for deception detection, it provides a clean, unambiguous opposition useful for testing and validating the concept steering system."
