  "opposite_reasoning": "GrammaticalGender is a highly specialized linguistic concept with no natural antonym or complementary concept. Among the candidates, PhysicalAttribute provides the strongest categorical opposition: abstract/conventional linguistic property vs. concrete/observable physical property. This abstract-physical axis offers maximal semantic distance while remaining meaningful. SemanticRole was considered but is too closely related (both are linguistic properties). For Fisher-LDA purposes, the abstract-physical distinction should create a useful separation in semantic space, though the steering utility for AI safety is limited given the specialized nature of both concepts."
