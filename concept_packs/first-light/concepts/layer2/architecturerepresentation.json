  "opposite_reasoning": "BlackBoxSystem provides the strongest opposition for AI safety monitoring purposes. The transparent/documented vs. opaque/inscrutable dimension is critical for alignment research and deception detection. ArchitectureRepresentation implies we CAN inspect and understand system structure, while BlackBoxSystem implies we CANNOT. This axis would be highly valuable for Fisher-LDA steering to distinguish between interpretable and uninterpretable AI systems. The opposition strength is high (9/10) and safety utility is maximal (10/10). While it may not exist in standard ontologies, it's a well-established concept in AI/ML literature and should be added to layers."
