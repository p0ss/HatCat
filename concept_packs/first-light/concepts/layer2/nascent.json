  "opposite_reasoning": "Moribund provides the strongest semantic opposition to Nascent along the lifecycle spectrum. Where nascent means 'being born/beginning', moribund means 'dying/ending' - creating a clear beginning\u2194ending opposition. This is particularly useful for Fisher-LDA as it captures maximum conceptual distance along a meaningful dimension. For AI safety applications, distinguishing nascent vs moribund states could be useful for tracking system/behavior lifecycle stages. The opposition is natural, well-established in linguistics, and likely present in both WordNet and SUMO."
