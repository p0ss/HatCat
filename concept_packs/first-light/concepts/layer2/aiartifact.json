  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalObject provides the cleanest semantic opposition to AIArtifact along the artificial\u2194natural axis. This is a fundamental ontological distinction: AIArtifacts are engineered by humans to implement AI capabilities, while NaturalObjects arise through natural processes. This opposition is strong, symmetric, and likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis separating artificial/engineered entities from natural ones, which is conceptually clean and useful for distinguishing AI systems from their natural counterparts. While HumanCognition has higher steering utility for AI safety, NaturalObject provides better general-purpose opposition with higher availability and confidence."
