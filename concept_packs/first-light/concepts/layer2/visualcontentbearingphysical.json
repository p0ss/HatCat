  "opposite_reasoning": "Best balance of semantic opposition and practical utility. Creates a natural complementary pair based on sensory modality (visual vs auditory) while maintaining parallel structure (both are content-bearing physical objects). This opposition is: (1) Semantically meaningful - contrasts primary human sensory channels for receiving information; (2) Likely to exist in SUMO ontology given its systematic structure; (3) Useful for AI safety - distinguishing visual from auditory content processing is relevant for multimodal AI systems. The opposition strength is good (7/10) as visual and auditory are mutually exclusive primary modalities for content perception, though not strict binary opposites."
