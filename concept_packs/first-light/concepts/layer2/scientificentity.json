  "opposite_reasoning": "Superstition provides the strongest semantic opposition to ScientificEntity for AI safety monitoring. It captures the fundamental epistemological divide between evidence-based, systematic inquiry (scientific method) and belief systems based on irrational connections or tradition. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis: scientific reasoning \u2194 superstitious thinking. This is highly relevant for AI safety in detecting when models confuse correlation with causation, make unfalsifiable claims, or rely on spurious patterns rather than sound reasoning. Superstition is widely recognized, likely exists in WordNet, and provides clear interpretability. While SubjectiveAssessment might be more nuanced, Superstition offers stronger cultural grounding and clearer opposition."
