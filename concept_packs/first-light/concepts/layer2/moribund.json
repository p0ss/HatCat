  "opposite_reasoning": "Healthy is the strongest semantic opposite for Moribund along the vitality/life-state spectrum. It provides maximum separability for Fisher-LDA: moribund represents failing/dying states while healthy represents well-functioning/thriving states. This opposition is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, ensuring availability. While the AI safety relevance is moderate (not directly related to deception/alignment), the concept is useful for understanding states of decline vs. flourishing, which could metaphorically apply to system health monitoring. The opposition is clear, unambiguous, and provides strong geometric separation for centroid anchoring."
