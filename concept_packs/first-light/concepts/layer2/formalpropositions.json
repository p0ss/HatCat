  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalLanguageText provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. It captures the core distinguishing features of FormalPropositions (symbolic precision, systematic structure, mathematical formalization) by contrasting with natural language's ambiguity, context-dependence, and lack of formal symbolic representation. This opposition is most useful for AI safety monitoring as it helps distinguish between formalized reasoning (proofs, equations, logical statements) and informal communication. It likely exists in SUMO and has high confidence. While 'InformalCommunication' might seem more directly opposite, NaturalLanguageText is more concrete and better anchored in existing ontologies."
