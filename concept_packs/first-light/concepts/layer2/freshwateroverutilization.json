  "opposite_reasoning": "FreshWaterConservation provides the strongest semantic opposition to FreshWaterOverutilization. It represents the positive counterpart on the resource management spectrum: while overutilization depletes resources unsustainably, conservation protects and preserves them. This opposition is intuitive, likely to be well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and creates a clear axis for Fisher-LDA between destructive overuse and protective preservation. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help detect concepts related to resource exploitation vs. stewardship, which has broader applications beyond water management."
