  "opposite_reasoning": "Anecdote provides the strongest semantic opposition to Statistics along the most relevant dimension: systematic quantitative analysis vs. singular qualitative observation. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety monitoring because it captures a fundamental epistemological distinction that appears in reasoning tasks - whether claims are supported by statistical evidence or merely anecdotal reports. This axis would help identify when AI systems inappropriately generalize from individual cases or fail to distinguish between rigorous data-driven arguments and narrative-based reasoning. The opposition is clear, pedagogically useful, and captures a real conceptual boundary relevant to evaluating evidence quality in AI outputs."
