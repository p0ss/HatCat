  "opposite_reasoning": "EngineMotion lacks a clear direct antonym since it's a specialized mechanical process. BiologicalProcess provides the strongest available opposition: mechanical/artificial vs organic/natural processes. Both are dynamic processes (maintaining same ontological level) but represent fundamentally different domains - engineered mechanical systems vs evolved biological systems. This contrast is semantically meaningful for Fisher-LDA while having strong availability in both WordNet and SUMO. It provides better steering utility than pure category oppositions (process vs object) while being more concrete than abstract mental processes."
