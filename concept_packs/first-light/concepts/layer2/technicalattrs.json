  "opposite_reasoning": "TechnicalAttrs represents objective, measurable, formal-system properties. The strongest semantic opposite is SubjectiveAssessmentAttribute, capturing the fundamental objective\u2194subjective dimension. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety: distinguishing between objective technical claims and subjective assessments is crucial for alignment monitoring and detecting when systems conflate factual statements with opinions. While this specific term may not exist in current ontologies, the concept is well-defined and should be added. The objective-subjective axis is foundational and more semantically pure than domain-based contrasts (technical vs social/psychological)."
