  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the best semantic opposition to Enterprise for Fisher-LDA steering. Enterprise represents organized, collective economic entities with formal structure, while Individual captures personal, non-organized, non-commercial agency. This opposition is useful for distinguishing between institutional/organizational behavior vs. personal behavior - relevant for AI safety in contexts like detecting corporate deception vs. personal honesty, understanding collective vs. individual responsibility, and monitoring organizational alignment. The concept exists in both WordNet and SUMO with high availability, and the opposition is semantically clean without category confusion."
