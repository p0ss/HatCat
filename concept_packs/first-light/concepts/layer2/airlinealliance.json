  "opposite_reasoning": "AirlineAlliance represents a cooperative agreement structure between organizations. The clearest opposition is organizations in competitive (not cooperative) relationships. CompetingOrganizations captures the cooperation\u2194competition dimension which is the core semantic content. This has stronger opposition than generic concepts like SolitaryAgent while being more general and likely available than the domain-specific IndependentAirlineOperation. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a meaningful axis: cooperative organizational structures vs competitive organizational structures."
