  "opposite_reasoning": "SpatialRelation is the strongest opposite for TemporalRelation because: (1) It represents a fundamental complementary distinction in ontology - time vs. space are the two core dimensions for relations; (2) Both are relation types at the same ontological level, making them naturally paired; (3) High availability in both WordNet and SUMO; (4) Creates a meaningful axis for distinguishing temporal concepts (before/after/duration) from spatial concepts (above/below/near); (5) For AI safety applications, this axis could help detect confusion between temporal and spatial reasoning, which is relevant for causal understanding and planning. Note: The provided definition appears to be incorrect for TemporalRelation - it describes a spatial deictic ('here') rather than temporal relations."
