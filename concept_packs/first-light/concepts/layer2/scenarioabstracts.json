  "opposite_reasoning": "ActualWorld provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. ScenarioAbstracts fundamentally deals with possible, hypothetical, or modeled states of affairs (including its child concept PossibleWorld). The most meaningful opposite is the actual, realized world - what is definitively the case rather than what might be or could be modeled. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety monitoring: distinguishing between when a system is reasoning about hypotheticals/scenarios vs. making claims about actual reality is crucial for deception detection (e.g., confabulation, counterfactual reasoning presented as fact). The concept likely exists in SUMO's modal logic framework, and if not, represents a critical addition. The ActualWorld\u2194PossibleWorld distinction is fundamental in formal ontology."
