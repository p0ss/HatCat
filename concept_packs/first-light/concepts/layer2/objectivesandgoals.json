  "opposite_reasoning": "Aimlessness provides the strongest semantic opposition to ObjectivesAndGoals for AI safety monitoring. It captures the fundamental distinction between purposeful, goal-directed behavior (critical for alignment) versus behavior lacking intention or direction. This opposition is particularly valuable for Fisher-LDA steering: it helps distinguish between AI systems operating with clear objectives versus those exhibiting purposeless or random behavior. For deception detection, understanding when an AI claims to have certain objectives but exhibits aimless behavior patterns would be a key safety signal. While it may not exist in SUMO currently, it likely exists in WordNet and should be added to layers as a critical concept for alignment research."
