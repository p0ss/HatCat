  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalOrganism provides the strongest complementary opposite for GeneticallyEngineeredOrganism. The definition explicitly states these organisms are 'not found originally in nature,' making naturally occurring organisms the clear semantic complement. This creates a clean binary useful for Fisher-LDA: organisms created through laboratory genetic manipulation vs. organisms that evolved/exist naturally. While NaturallyOccurringOrganism is more explicit, NaturalOrganism is more concise and likely exists in SUMO. For AI safety steering, this opposition could help identify concepts related to artificial vs. natural, engineered vs. evolved - relevant for understanding AI attitudes toward natural vs. modified systems."
