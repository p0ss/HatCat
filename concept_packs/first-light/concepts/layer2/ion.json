  "opposite_reasoning": "Cation is the perfect binary opposite of anion (negatively charged ion). This is a fundamental chemical opposition based on charge polarity: negative vs. positive. The definition explicitly states 'negatively charged ion' which is the chemical definition of anion, making cation (positively charged ion) the canonical opposite. This provides maximum opposition strength for Fisher-LDA steering. While not directly relevant to AI safety/deception detection, it provides the clearest semantic separation for this physical chemistry concept."
