  "opposite_reasoning": "Herbivore provides the strongest practical opposition to Fungivore. Both are specialized dietary categories representing exclusive consumption of different biological kingdoms (Plantae vs Fungi). This creates a clear taxonomic complementarity useful for Fisher-LDA separation. Herbivore is widely available in both WordNet and SUMO, making it immediately usable. While not a binary antonym, the complementary nature of these feeding strategies (plant-specialist vs fungus-specialist) provides sufficient semantic distance for effective concept axis definition. The opposition is more meaningful than carnivore/omnivore because it maintains similar selectivity while differing in target kingdom."
