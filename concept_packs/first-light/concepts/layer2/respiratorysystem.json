  "opposite_reasoning": "RespiratorySystem is a highly specific concrete biological entity. For Fisher-LDA purposes, the strongest semantic opposition comes from the concrete-abstract dimension rather than comparing to sibling organ systems (which are too similar and would create weak separation). AbstractEntity provides maximal semantic distance while remaining ontologically principled. This creates a clear physical-vs-conceptual axis that will be useful for distinguishing concrete biological concepts from abstract reasoning. While organ system siblings exist, they don't provide strong enough opposition for effective centroid separation."
