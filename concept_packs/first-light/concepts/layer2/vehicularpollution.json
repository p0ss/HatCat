  "opposite_reasoning": "EnvironmentalRestoration provides the strongest semantic opposition as a process that directly reverses environmental damage caused by pollution. Both are active processes in the environmental domain but with opposite directionality (degradation vs restoration). This creates a meaningful Fisher-LDA axis for measuring environmental impact orientation. While CleanAir has higher availability, the process-to-process opposition is more semantically coherent for LDA centroid anchoring. For AI safety applications, this axis could help detect/steer discussions about environmental responsibility vs harm."
