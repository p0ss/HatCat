  "opposite_reasoning": "Abstract is the strongest semantic opposite because it represents the fundamental Physical\u2194Abstract distinction that is core to SUMO ontology. PhysicalDimension specifically deals with measurable physical properties (length, mass, force), while Abstract encompasses non-physical, conceptual entities that cannot have physical measurements. This opposition is well-established in ontology, exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides clear semantic separation for Fisher-LDA. While this opposition may have moderate utility for AI safety applications (distinguishing physical from conceptual reasoning), it offers excellent opposition strength and availability."
