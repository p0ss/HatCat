  "opposite_reasoning": "PersonalRelation provides the strongest available opposition for BusinessPropositions. It creates a semantically meaningful axis distinguishing formal commercial arrangements from informal personal relationships. This opposition is useful for AI safety monitoring to distinguish business contexts from personal contexts, which may have different ethical considerations and deception patterns. While BusinessRejection would be a stronger direct opposite, it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies. PersonalRelation exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it immediately deployable without requiring layer additions. The commercial/formal vs. personal/informal axis is interpretable and useful for concept steering."
