  "opposite_reasoning": "Physical is the strongest semantic opposite for MentalAbstracts, representing the foundational mind-body or abstract-concrete distinction in ontology. It provides maximum opposition strength (mental vs physical is a clear dichotomy), has guaranteed availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and offers strong steering utility for AI safety applications. This opposition helps distinguish between internal mental representations and external physical reality\u2014crucial for understanding AI world models, grounding, and the relationship between beliefs and physical facts. The Physical/Mental divide is also well-established in SUMO's upper ontology structure."
