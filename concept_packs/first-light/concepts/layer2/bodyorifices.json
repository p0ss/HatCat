  "opposite_reasoning": "While BodyOrifices lacks a perfect antonym, Skin provides the most practical and available opposition. Skin represents the continuous, closed barrier of the body, while orifices are interruptions/openings in this barrier. This captures a meaningful open\u2194closed, passage\u2194barrier complementarity. Skin has high availability (exists in both WordNet and SUMO), making it immediately usable. Though not a perfect semantic opposite, it provides sufficient contrast for Fisher-LDA separation and is anatomically meaningful. Alternative: BodySurface would be more conceptually precise but has lower availability."
