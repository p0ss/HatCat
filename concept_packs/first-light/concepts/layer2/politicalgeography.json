  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalGeography provides the strongest semantic opposition to PoliticalGeography within the geographic domain. This opposition captures the fundamental distinction between human-constructed political boundaries/divisions and naturally-occurring physical features. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful axis distinguishing politically-defined regions (nations, counties, cities) from natural features (rivers, mountains, landforms). The opposition is conceptually clean, likely exists in SUMO ontology, and provides useful semantic distance. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it's valuable for geographic reasoning and understanding distinctions between artificial and natural categorizations."
