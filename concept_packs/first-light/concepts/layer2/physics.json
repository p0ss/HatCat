  "opposite_reasoning": "Metaphysics provides the strongest conceptual opposition to Physics. While Physics studies the empirical, measurable, physical aspects of reality (matter, energy, forces), Metaphysics studies the abstract, non-empirical aspects (being, existence, causality, reality beyond the physical). This is a well-established philosophical distinction with high availability in both WordNet and SUMO. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis from physical/empirical (Physics) to abstract/non-empirical (Metaphysics), which could be useful for distinguishing between concrete physical reasoning and abstract philosophical reasoning in AI safety monitoring."
