  "opposite_reasoning": "Fertilizer is the strongest opposite for Defoliant because it represents the functional complementary opposite in agricultural chemistry: destruction vs. growth promotion. Both are chemical substances applied to plants with diametrically opposed purposes and effects. Fertilizer exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available. For Fisher-LDA, this opposition creates a clear axis between plant-destructive and plant-nurturing substances, which should yield strong discriminative power. While less relevant to deception detection specifically, it represents a clean semantic opposition useful for general concept steering."
