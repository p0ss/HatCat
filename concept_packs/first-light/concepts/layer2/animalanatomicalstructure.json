  "opposite_reasoning": "PlantAnatomicalStructure provides the strongest taxonomic opposition - both concepts represent organized biological structures but from mutually exclusive kingdoms (Animalia vs Plantae). This creates a clean biological parallel: animal-specific organs/tissues vs plant-specific organs/tissues. The opposition is semantically meaningful, conceptually clear, and maintains domain consistency (both are anatomical structures, just from different kingdoms). This is ideal for Fisher-LDA as it separates two well-defined biological feature spaces. While less directly relevant to AI safety/deception detection, it provides robust concept separation for biological knowledge representation."
