  "opposite_reasoning": "NonprofitOrganization provides the strongest and most meaningful opposition to CommercialAgent. Both are organizational entities that provide products/services, but they differ fundamentally on the profit-seeking dimension - the defining characteristic of commercial agents. This opposition is: (1) Clear and conceptually clean - mutually exclusive in organizational purpose; (2) Useful for AI safety steering - distinguishing profit-driven vs. mission-driven behavior is relevant for detecting misaligned incentives; (3) Likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO as it's a well-established organizational category; (4) Creates a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA that captures the commercial/nonprofit dimension of agent behavior. The opposition is stronger than Government (which can sometimes operate commercially) and more specific than PrivateIndividual (which is too broad)."
