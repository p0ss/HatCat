  "opposite_reasoning": "EnvironmentalProtection is the strongest complementary opposite to IndustrialPollution. It represents organized, intentional processes to prevent environmental degradation, directly opposing the harmful effects of industrial pollution. This pairing is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring as it captures the axis between harmful industrial externalities and protective/preventive measures. The concept likely exists in SUMO (as it's a well-established domain) and provides excellent steering utility for distinguishing between environmentally harmful and beneficial processes. The semantic distance is strong while remaining conceptually coherent."
