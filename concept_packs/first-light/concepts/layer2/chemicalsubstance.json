  "opposite_reasoning": "Abstract is the strongest opposite for ChemicalSubstance because it represents the fundamental Physical-vs-Abstract ontological distinction in SUMO. ChemicalSubstance is inherently physical, material, and concrete (molecules, acids, drugs), while Abstract encompasses non-physical entities (propositions, attributes, relations). This opposition is: (1) well-established in upper ontology design, (2) maximally separable in semantic space, (3) highly available in both WordNet and SUMO, and (4) provides clean Fisher-LDA separation. For AI safety monitoring, this axis helps distinguish between reasoning about physical/material concepts versus abstract/conceptual reasoning."
