  "opposite_reasoning": "HydrophilicLipidHead is the strongest semantic opposite because it represents the complementary structural component of the same molecular class (lipids). In biochemistry, lipid molecules are amphipathic - they have both hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads. This creates a perfect binary opposition that is both scientifically accurate and maximally separable in semantic space. The hydrophobic tail-hydrophilic head distinction is fundamental to lipid bilayer formation and membrane structure. While this concept has low steering utility for AI safety applications (as it's a specialized biochemistry term), it provides the strongest opposition for accurate concept representation in the ontology."
