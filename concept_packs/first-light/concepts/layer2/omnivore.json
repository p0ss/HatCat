  "opposite_reasoning": "While Omnivore lacks a single binary antonym (it exists in a triad with Carnivore and Herbivore), Herbivore provides the most practical opposition for Fisher-LDA. Herbivore is maximally distinct in the animal-vegetable diet dimension (plant-only vs. both), has guaranteed availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and forms a clean taxonomic complement. Carnivore would work equally well, but Herbivore represents greater conceptual distance in the 'vegetable substances' aspect of the definition. For AI safety steering, this opposition has limited direct utility but maintains ontological coherence for biological classification tasks."
