  "opposite_reasoning": "BiologicalSubstance provides the strongest complementary opposition within the same ontological tier (both are natural substances). This creates a clean, interpretable axis: geological (abiotic, inorganic earth materials) \u2194 biological (biotic, organic living materials). This opposition is: (1) semantically clear and mutually exclusive, (2) balanced in scope - both are substance categories, (3) likely well-represented in natural language corpora with distinct semantic spaces, (4) practically useful for distinguishing between earth/mineral concepts vs life/organic concepts. The geological/biological distinction is fundamental in natural sciences and should produce a robust Fisher-LDA axis. Alternative: If BiologicalSubstance lacks sufficient corpus representation, Organism would be the strong fallback as it's well-established in WordNet and provides the animate/inanimate distinction."
