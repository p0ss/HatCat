  "opposite_reasoning": "WaterConservation is the most pragmatic choice as it: (1) has strong semantic opposition to overutilization (preservation vs. depletion), (2) likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, (3) represents a normatively positive behavior opposite to the negative behavior of overutilization, and (4) provides clear separation for Fisher-LDA axes. While SustainableWaterUse is definitionally more precise, WaterConservation has better availability and is a well-established concept. For AI safety monitoring of resource management behaviors, this pairing effectively distinguishes responsible vs. irresponsible resource use patterns."
