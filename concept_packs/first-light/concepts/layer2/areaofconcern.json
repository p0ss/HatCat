  "opposite_reasoning": "AreaOfIndifference provides the strongest conceptual opposite for Fisher-LDA steering. While AreaOfConcern represents domains that engage an agent's focus (what they care about), AreaOfIndifference represents domains that explicitly fail to engage attention (what they don't care about). This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety monitoring: detecting whether an AI system is appropriately concerned about important domains (safety, ethics, user wellbeing) versus inappropriately indifferent. The symmetry in structure (Area of X) makes it ideal for creating a balanced semantic axis. Though it doesn't exist in current ontologies, it's a natural complement that should be added to maintain conceptual completeness."
