  "opposite_reasoning": "While NonInheritableRelation would be the ideal logical complement, it doesn't exist in current ontologies. Entity provides the strongest available opposition: it represents the fundamental ontological distinction between relations (which connect/describe) and entities (which exist as objects). This category-level opposition is well-established in philosophical ontology, exists in both WordNet and SUMO (high availability score of 10), and provides clear semantic separation for Fisher-LDA. The Relation\u2194Entity distinction is fundamental enough to generate meaningful concept axes. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing relational reasoning from entity-based reasoning could be valuable."
