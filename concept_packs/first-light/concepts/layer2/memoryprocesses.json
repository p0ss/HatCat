  "opposite_reasoning": "ReflexProcess provides the strongest cognitive opposition to MemoryProcesses. Memory processes represent higher-order, deliberate cognitive operations involving stored mental representations (encoding, consolidation, retrieval, manipulation), while reflex processes are automatic, involuntary responses that operate without cognitive mediation or reference to stored experiences. This distinction is fundamental in neuroscience and psychology: controlled vs. automatic processing, deliberate vs. reflexive action, memory-dependent vs. memory-independent responses. For AI safety applications, this axis could help distinguish between deliberative reasoning (potentially involving memory of goals, past interactions, learned deceptions) versus reactive responses. The opposition is clean, well-established in cognitive science, and likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies."
