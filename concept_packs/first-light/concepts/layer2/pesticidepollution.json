  "opposite_reasoning": "EnvironmentalRestoration provides the strongest semantic opposition to PesticidePollution. While PesticidePollution represents degradation of environmental quality through contamination, restoration represents the active reversal of such damage. This creates a clear process-level opposition (degradation vs. repair) that is maximally useful for Fisher-LDA concept axes. The opposition is more specific and actionable than general 'protection' or 'conservation,' and more broadly applicable than domain-specific alternatives like organic farming. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish harmful vs. beneficial environmental processes."
