  "opposite_reasoning": "Employee is the canonical antonym of Employer, representing the complementary role in the employment relationship. This is a textbook example of relational opposition where the two concepts define each other: an Employer cannot exist without Employees, and vice versa. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separation as the semantic features that define 'providing employment' are directly opposite to 'receiving employment'. The opposition is clear, well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides strong utility for concept steering. While AI safety relevance is moderate (not directly related to deception/alignment), it's valuable for understanding economic and social relationships."
