  "opposite_reasoning": "Arbitrariness provides the strongest semantic opposition to Justification by representing the complete absence of rational basis or evidence for beliefs/decisions. While Justification characterizes beliefs supported by evidence or reasoning, Arbitrariness characterizes beliefs/actions taken without such support. This creates a clean epistemic axis from 'evidence-based' to 'groundless'. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is valuable for detecting when systems make decisions without proper reasoning chains. Though Arbitrariness may not exist in current SUMO layers, it represents a fundamental epistemic concept worthy of inclusion. The opposition is philosophically sound and operationally useful for Fisher-LDA steering between justified and arbitrary belief states."
