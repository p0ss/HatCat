  "opposite_reasoning": "Intuition provides the strongest semantic opposition to Mathematics for Fisher-LDA purposes. The opposition captures a fundamental epistemological divide: Mathematics represents formal, systematic, rule-based reasoning with explicit methodology (algebra and calculus), while Intuition represents informal, immediate understanding without systematic methodology. This distinction is particularly valuable for AI safety monitoring because it relates to how AI systems should balance formal reasoning vs. heuristic pattern-matching, and could help detect when systems inappropriately rely on one mode over another. The concept likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it practically available. The opposition is meaningful across multiple dimensions: formal/informal, systematic/non-systematic, explicit/implicit, which creates strong separation in concept space for the Fisher-LDA negative centroid."
