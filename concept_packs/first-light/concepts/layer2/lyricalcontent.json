  "opposite_reasoning": "InstrumentalMusic provides the strongest semantic opposition within the musical domain. LyricalContent and InstrumentalMusic represent complementary, mutually exclusive aspects of musical composition - one emphasizes verbal/textual content, the other emphasizes music without words. This opposition is clean, intuitive, and maintains domain coherence. While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (not directly related to deception/alignment), the opposition strength is high and it's a natural conceptual anchor. Both concepts likely exist in standard ontologies and would create a meaningful Fisher-LDA axis for distinguishing text-based vs. non-verbal musical content."
