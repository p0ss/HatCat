  "opposite_reasoning": "SoilConservation is the most pragmatic choice as it likely exists in SUMO ontology (conservation processes are well-documented) and represents a clear process-level opposite: while SoilDegradation describes processes that lower soil capacity, SoilConservation describes processes that maintain and protect it. Although SoilEnrichment might be conceptually stronger as a direct inverse, SoilConservation has higher availability and is a more established term in environmental science ontologies. It captures the preventative/protective stance versus the degradative trajectory, making it suitable for Fisher-LDA axis formation where the distinction between harmful and protective environmental processes is meaningful."
