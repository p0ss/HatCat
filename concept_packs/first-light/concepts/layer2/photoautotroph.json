  "opposite_reasoning": "Chemoheterotroph represents the most precise biological opposite to Photoautotroph. While 'Heterotroph' is broader and more likely to exist in current layers, Chemoheterotroph captures both key oppositions: (1) energy source: light vs chemical, and (2) carbon source: autotrophic vs heterotrophic. This provides the strongest semantic separation for Fisher-LDA axes. The term is well-established in biological taxonomy and should exist in comprehensive ontologies. If the goal is maximum conceptual distance with clear biological grounding, this is optimal. However, if availability is prioritized over precision, Heterotroph serves as an excellent fallback."
