  "opposite_reasoning": "PsychologicalAttribute provides the strongest and most useful opposition to DeviceAttrs. It captures multiple complementary dimensions: (1) mechanical/technical vs. mental/emotional, (2) non-sentient vs. sentient, (3) objective-measurable vs. subjective-experiential, (4) physical-device properties vs. psychological-agent properties. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between device-level technical attributes and psychological/mental attributes is crucial for monitoring whether AI systems are being treated as mere tools vs. agents with psychological properties. This opposition has high confidence due to its presence in both WordNet and SUMO, and offers strong semantic distance while remaining conceptually coherent."
