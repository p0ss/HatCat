  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalCognition is the strongest opposite for SocialCognition because it captures a fundamental dimension highly relevant to AI safety: the distinction between reasoning about minds/social systems versus reasoning about physical systems. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is crucial for detecting when models are engaging in social manipulation (theory of mind, influence processes) versus physical reasoning. The Social\u2194Physical cognitive dimension is well-established in cognitive science and neuroscience. While this concept doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it should be added as it provides maximum steering utility for detecting deceptive social cognition patterns. The opposition is strong (8/10) because these represent fundamentally different cognitive domains with distinct neural substrates and computational requirements."
