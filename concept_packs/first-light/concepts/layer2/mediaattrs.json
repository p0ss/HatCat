  "opposite_reasoning": "MediaAttrs is a highly specialized concept describing technical properties of external media artifacts. The strongest opposition is InternalStateAttribute, which captures the external\u2194internal distinction. This creates a meaningful axis distinguishing between: (1) attributes of external, observable media content vs. (2) attributes of internal mental/cognitive states. This is semantically strong (8/10 opposition), useful for distinguishing content properties from agent properties in AI safety contexts, and likely exists in SUMO. The external\u2194internal axis is more fundamental than objective\u2194subjective, and more directly opposed than physical attributes (which could also be external)."
