  "opposite_reasoning": "Abstract is the strongest semantic opposite to PhysicalWorld, representing the fundamental ontological distinction between concrete/material and non-physical/conceptual entities. This is a well-established SUMO pair that exists in both WordNet and SUMO. The Physical-Abstract axis provides maximum separation in concept space and is foundational for ontological classification. While IntentionalProcess scores higher on steering_utility for AI safety, Abstract provides cleaner, more fundamental opposition with higher confidence and availability. The Physical-Abstract distinction is also more stable and less context-dependent than other candidates."
