  "opposite_reasoning": "InanimateObject provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA steering: it is maximally distant from MindsAndAgents across all key dimensions (no cognition, no agency, no intentionality, no communication). It definitely exists in both SUMO and WordNet, ensuring availability. For AI safety monitoring, the Agent\u2194InanimateObject axis is crucial for detecting when systems treat entities inappropriately (e.g., attributing agency where none exists, or failing to recognize genuine agents). While PhysicalNonAgentive would be theoretically stronger, InanimateObject has better availability and established usage."
