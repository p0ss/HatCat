  "opposite_reasoning": "Physical is the strongest opposite for Information in the SUMO ontology framework. This captures the fundamental abstract/concrete distinction that is central to ontological organization. Information encompasses abstract entities (propositions, relations, concepts) while Physical encompasses concrete material entities. This opposition provides maximal semantic distance for Fisher-LDA while being well-grounded in both SUMO and WordNet. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between abstract informational content and physical instantiation is important for reasoning about representations, models, and reality. The opposition is clean, well-established, and provides strong discriminative power."
