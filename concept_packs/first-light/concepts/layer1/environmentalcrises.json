  "opposite_reasoning": "EnvironmentalRestoration provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA axes. It represents the inverse process trajectory: where EnvironmentalCrises involve degradation, depletion, and contamination, EnvironmentalRestoration involves recovery, replenishment, and remediation. This creates a clear directional axis (crisis\u2192restoration) useful for conceptual steering. While it may not exist as a single term in SUMO, it's conceptually coherent and would capture activities like reforestation, wetland restoration, soil remediation, and pollution cleanup - the direct counterprocesses to the child categories of EnvironmentalCrises. For AI safety applications, distinguishing crisis narratives from restoration narratives could be valuable for detecting manipulation around environmental topics."
