  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalObject provides the strongest semantic opposition to PhysicalMedia. The key distinction is representational/symbolic vs. non-representational/non-symbolic. PhysicalMedia includes text, icons, brands - things that mean something beyond their physical substrate. PhysicalObject captures pure physical entities without symbolic content (e.g., a rock, a blank piece of metal). This opposition is clean, well-established in SUMO, and provides good semantic distance for Fisher-LDA while remaining conceptually coherent. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between symbolic representations and non-symbolic physical entities could help identify when systems are treating symbols inappropriately (e.g., confusing the map for the territory)."
