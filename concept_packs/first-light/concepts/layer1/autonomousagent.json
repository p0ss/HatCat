  "opposite_reasoning": "PassiveObject provides the strongest semantic opposition to AutonomousAgent across multiple dimensions: (1) lacks agency/volition, (2) cannot initiate actions, (3) is acted upon rather than acting, (4) has no autonomous decision-making. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety applications where distinguishing between autonomous systems and passive tools/objects is critical. The concept likely exists in SUMO as 'Object' with passive attributes, or can be composed from existing SUMO primitives. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis from 'things that act autonomously' to 'things that are inert and passive', which is highly interpretable and useful for monitoring autonomous AI behavior."
