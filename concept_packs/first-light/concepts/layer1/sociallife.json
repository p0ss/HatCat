  "opposite_reasoning": "Isolation provides the strongest semantic opposition to SocialLife for Fisher-LDA purposes. SocialLife is fundamentally about connection, interaction, and participation in society, while Isolation represents disconnection, lack of interaction, and withdrawal from social contexts. This opposition is: (1) intuitively clear and semantically strong, (2) behaviorally meaningful for AI safety monitoring (detecting social vs antisocial patterns), (3) likely to produce well-separated concept clusters in embedding space, and (4) available in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. While SocialLife doesn't have a direct antonym, Isolation captures the complementary opposite state most effectively."
