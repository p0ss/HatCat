  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest and most fundamental semantic opposition to SetOrClass. This captures the core mereological distinction between collections/populations (many) and singular entities (one). In SUMO ontology, Individual and SetOrClass are disjoint top-level categories, making this a clean ontological opposition. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis: collective/group/population vs. singular/atomic/particular. This is highly relevant for AI safety in distinguishing between reasoning about populations/categories vs. specific instances, which is important for detecting overgeneralization, stereotyping, or improper abstraction. The concept definitely exists in both WordNet and SUMO as a fundamental ontological primitive."
