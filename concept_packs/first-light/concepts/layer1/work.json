  "opposite_reasoning": "Rest is the strongest candidate as the direct WordNet antonym with clear semantic opposition. It contrasts Work on all key dimensions: activity vs inactivity, energy expenditure vs conservation, directed effort vs cessation. The work-rest dichotomy is well-established across multiple domains (thermodynamics, physiology, process theory). For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clean axis: Work represents ordered, purposeful energy transfer while Rest represents the absence of such transfer. This is particularly useful for AI safety monitoring to distinguish between active computational processes (reasoning, planning, execution) versus idle states. High availability (exists in both WordNet and SUMO) and maximum confidence make this the safest choice."
