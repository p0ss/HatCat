  "definition": "A generalized tonic\u2013clonic\nseizure, commonly known as a grand mal seizure or GTCS, is a type\nof generalized seizure that produces bilateral, convulsive tonic and\nclonic muscle contractions. Tonic\u2013clonic seizures are the seizure type\nmost commonly associated with epilepsy and seizures in general and the\nmost common seizure associated with metabolic imbalances. It is a\nmisconception that they are the sole type of seizure, as they are the\nmain seizure type in approximately 10% of those with epilepsy.[from\nWikipedia]",
