  "definition": "&%LaNinaPhase has roughly the reverse pattern: \nhigh pressure over the central and eastern Pacific and lower pressure through much of the rest of \nthe tropics and subtropics. An especially strong Walker circulation causes La Ni\u00f1a, where sea \nsurface temperature across the eastern equatorial part of the central Pacific Ocean will be \nlower than normal by 3\u20135 \u00b0C (5.4\u20139 \u00b0F). The phenomenon occurs as strong winds blow warm water at\nthe ocean's surface away from South America, across the Pacific Ocean towards Indonesia.\nAs this warm water moves west, cold water from the deep sea rises to the surface near South \nAmerica.[Wikipedia] Operational definition used by NOAA uses a 3-month running mean, and to be \nclassified as a full-fledged La Nina, the anomalies must exceed -0.5C for at least five consecutive months.",
