  "definition": "Blood plasma is a light amber colored liquid component of blood\nin which blood cells are absent, but which contains proteins and other constituents of whole blood in\nsuspension. It makes up about 55% of the body's total blood volume. It is the intravascular part of\nextracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and\ncontains important dissolved proteins (6\u20138%; e.g., serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen),\nglucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3\u2212, Cl\u2212, etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide\n(plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and oxygen. It plays a vital\nrole in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte concentration balanced and protects\nthe body from infection and other blood related disorders.[from Wikipedia]",
