  "definition": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a group o\nbacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of &%Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is\nresponsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. It caused more than 100,000 deaths\nattributable to antimicrobial resistance in 2019. MRSA is any strain of S. aureus that has developed\n(through natural selection) or acquired (through horizontal gene transfer) a multiple drug resistance\nto beta-lactam antibiotics.\nMRSA is common in &%HospitalBuildings, &%Prisons, and nursing homes, where people with open wounds, invasive devices\nsuch as catheters, and weakened immune systems are at greater risk of healthcare associated infection. MRSA\nbegan as a hospital-acquired infection but has become community-acquired, as well as &%Livestock -acquired. The\nterms HA-MRSA (healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired MRSA), CA-MRSA (community-associated MRSA), and\nLA-MRSA (livestock-associated MRSA) reflect this.[from Wikipedia]",
