  "definition": "A &%WindGust is a sudden increase in the \nwind speed. It usually lasts for less than 20 seconds, briefer than a squall, \nwhich lasts minutes. A gust is followed by a lull (or slackening) in the wind speed. \nThe average value of wind speed is generally measured over a period of 2 minutes \nbefore the meteorological observation according to the World Meteorological Organization.  \nIt is generally reported in METAR when the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots \n(30 km/h; 18 mph) and the variation in wind speed between the peaks and average wind \nis at least 9 to 10 knots (17 to 19 km/h; 10 to 12 mph).[Wikipedia]",
