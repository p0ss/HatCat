  "definition": "Fentanyl is a highly potent\nsynthetic piperidine opioid drug primarily used as an analgesic. Because fentanyl is 50 to 100\ntimes more potent than &%Morphine, its primary clinical utility is in &%Pain management for &%Cancer\npatients and those recovering from painful surgical operations. Fentanyl is also used as a\nsedative. Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and\ningesting a relatively small quantity can cause overdose. Fentanyl works by activating\nmu-opioid receptors. [from Wikipedia]",
