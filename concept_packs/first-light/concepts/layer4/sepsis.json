  "definition": "Sepsis is a life-threatening\ncondition that arises when the body's response to infection causes\ninjury to its own &%Tissues and &%Organs. This initial stage is\nfollowed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and\nsymptoms include &%Fever, increased &%heartRate, increased breathing\nrate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific\ninfection, such as a &%Cough with &%Pneumonia, or painful &%Urination\nwith a &%Kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a\nweakened immune system may have no symptoms of a specific infection,\nand the body temperature may be low or normal instead of having a\nfever. Severe sepsis causes poor organ function or blood flow. The\npresence of low blood pressure (&%systoligBloodPressure and/or\n&%diastolicBloodPressure), high blood lactate, or low &%Urine output may\nsuggest poor blood flow. Septic shock is low blood pressure due to\nsepsis that does not improve after fluid replacement. Sepsis is\ncaused by many &%Organisms including a &%Bacterium, &%Virus or\n&%Fungus.[from Wikipedia]",
