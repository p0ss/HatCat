  "definition": "Focal seizures (also\ncalled partial seizures and localized seizures) are seizures which\naffect initially only one hemisphere of the brain. The brain is\ndivided into two hemispheres, each consisting of four lobes \u2013 the\nfrontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. A focal seizure is\ngenerated in and affects just one part of the brain \u2013 a whole\nhemisphere or part of a lobe. Symptoms will vary according to where\nthe seizure occurs. When seizures occur in the frontal lobe the\npatient may experience a wave-like sensation in the head. When\nseizures occur in the temporal lobe, a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu may be\nexperienced. When seizures are localized to the parietal lobe, a\nnumbness or tingling may occur. With seizures occurring in the\noccipital lobe, visual disturbances or hallucinations have been\nreported.[from Wikipedia]",
