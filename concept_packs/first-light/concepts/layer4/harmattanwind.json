  "definition": "&%HarmattanWind is a dry and dusty northeasterly \ntrade wind, which blows from the Sahara over West Africa into the Gulf of Guinea. The name is \nrelated to the word haramata in the Twi language. The HarmattanWind blows during the dry season, \nwhich occurs during the months with the lowest sun. On its passage over the Sahara, the Harmattan \npicks fine dust and sand particles (between 0.5 and 10 microns). &%HarmattanWind blows in the \nseason of Harmattan, of the same name, in West Aftica that occurs between end of November and middle \nof March.The &%HarmattanWind brings desert-like weather conditions: it lowers the humidity, \ndissipates cloud cover, prevents rainfall formation and sometimes creates big clouds of dust which \ncan result in dust storms or sandstorms.[Wikipedia]",
