  "definition": "Carnitine is a quaternary\nammonium compound involved in metabolism in most &%Mammals, &%Plants, and\nsome &%Bacteria. In support of energy metabolism, carnitine\ntransports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to be oxidized for\nenergy production, and also participates in removing products of\nmetabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is\nconcentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that\nmetabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Healthy individuals,\nincluding strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo to\nnot require supplementation.[from Wikipedia]",
