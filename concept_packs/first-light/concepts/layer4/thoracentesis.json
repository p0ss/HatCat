  "definition": "Thoracentesis, also known as thoracocentesis\npleural tap, needle thoracostomy, or needle decompression (often used term),\nis an invasive medical procedure to remove &%Fluid or &%Air from the pleural space\nfor diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. A cannula, or hollow needle, is carefully\nintroduced into the thorax, generally after administration of local &%Anesthesia.\nThe recommended location varies depending upon the source. Some sources recommend the\nmidaxillary line, in the eighth, ninth, or tenth intercostal space. Whenever possible, the\nprocedure should be performed under ultrasound guidance, which has shown to reduce complications.\nTension &%Pneumothorax is a medical emergency that requires needle decompression before a chest\ntube is placed.[from Wikipedia]",
