In human\nfemales and other &%Primates, the urethra connects to the urinary meatus above the &%Vagina, whereas\nin &%Marsupials, the female's urethra empties into the urogenital sinus.\nFemales use their urethra only for &%Urination, but males use their urethra for both urination and\nejaculation. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control\nover urination. The internal sphincter, formed by the involuntary smooth &%Muscles lining the\nbladder neck and urethra, receives its &%Nerve supply by the sympathetic division of the autonomic\nnervous system. The internal sphincter is present both in males and females. [from Wikipedia]",
