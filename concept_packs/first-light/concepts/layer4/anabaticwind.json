  "definition": "&%AnabaticWind is a warm wind which blows\nup a steep slop or mountain side, driven by heating of slope through insolation. It\ntypically occurs during the daytime in calm sunny weather. A hill or mountain \ntop will be radiatively warmed by the Sun which in turn heats the air just above it. \nAir at a similar altitude over an adjacent valley or plain does not get warmed so \nmuch because of the greater distance to the ground below it.[Wikipedia]",
