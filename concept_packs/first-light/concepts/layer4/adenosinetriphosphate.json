  "definition": "Adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) is an organic compound and hydrotrope that provides\nenergy to drive many processes in living cells, such as\n&%MuscularContraction, nerve impulse propagation, condensate\ndissolution, and chemical synthesis. Found in all known forms of life,\nATP is often referred to as the 'molecular unit of currency' of\nintracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes,\nit converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine\nmonophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human\nbody recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. It is\nalso a precursor to &%DNAMolecule and &%RNAMolecule, and is used as a\ncoenzyme.
