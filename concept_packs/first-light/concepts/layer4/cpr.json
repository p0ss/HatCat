  "definition": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure\nconsisting of chest compressions often combined with artificial ventilation, or &%Mouth to mouth in an\neffort to manually preserve intact &%Brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous\n&%BloodCirculation and &%Breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is recommended for those who are\nunresponsive with no breathing or abnormal &%Breathing, for example, agonal respirations.\nCPR involves chest compressions for adults between 5 cm (2.0 in) and 6 cm (2.4 in) deep and at a rate of\nat least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either &%Exhaling\nair into the subject's mouth or &%Nose (mouth to mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into\nthe subject's &%Lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-\nquality chest compressions over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving only chest\ncompressions is recommended for untrained rescuers.\nCPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart. Its main purpose is to restore the partial flow of oxygenated\nblood to the &%Brain and &%Heart. The objective is to delay &%Tissue &%Death and to extend the brief window of\nopportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent &%Brain damage. Administration of an electric\nshock to the subject's &%Heart, termed &%Defibrillation, is usually needed to restore a viable, or 'perfusing',\nheart rhythm.  In general, CPR is\ncontinued until the person has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or is declared &%Dead.[from Wikipedia]",
