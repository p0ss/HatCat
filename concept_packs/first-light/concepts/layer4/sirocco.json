  "definition": "&%Sirocco or scirocco is a Mediterranean \nwind that comes from the Sahara and can reach hurricane speeds in North Africa and \nSouthern Europe, especially during the summer season. Siroccos arise from warm, dry, \ntropical air masses that are pulled northward by low-pressure cells moving eastward \nacross the Mediterranean Sea, with the wind originating in the Arabian or Sahara \ndeserts.The hotter, drier continental air mixes with the cooler, wetter air of the \nmaritime cyclone, and the counter-clockwise circulation of the low propels the mixed \nair across the southern coasts of Europe.The sirocco causes dusty dry conditions along \nthe northern coast of Africa, storms in the Mediterranean Sea, and warm wet weather \nin Southern Europe. The sirocco does not affect other parts of Europe.[Wikipedia]",
