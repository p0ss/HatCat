  "definition": "&%ElNinoPhase is associated with higher than normal \nair sea level pressure over Indonesia, Australia and across the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. \nEl Ni\u00f1o conditions are established when the Walker circulation weakens or reverses and the \nHadley circulation strengthens,leading to the development of a band of warm ocean water \nin the central and east-central equatorial Pacific (approximately between the International Date \nLine and 120\u00b0W), including the area off the west coast of South America,as upwelling of cold \nwater occurs less or not at all offshore. This warming causes a shift in the atmospheric \ncirculation, leading to higher air pressure in the western Pacific and lower in the eastern \nPacific, with rainfall reducing over Indonesia, India and northern Australia, while rainfall \nand tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical Pacific Ocean.[Wikipedia]\nOperational definition used by NOAA uses a 3-month running mean, and to be classified as a \nfull-fledged El Nino, the anomalies must exceed +0.5C for at least five consecutive months.",
