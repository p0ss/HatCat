  "definition": "Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for monitoring a\nperson's &%Blood &%Oxygen saturation. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) readings are typically within 2%\naccuracy (within 4% accuracy in 95% of cases) of the more accurate (and invasive) reading of arterial\noxygen saturation (SaO2) from arterial blood gas analysis. The most common approach is transmissive pulse\noximetry. In this approach, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a\nfingertip or earlobe, or an infant's foot. The device passes two wavelengths of light through the\n&%BodyPart to a photodetector. It measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing\nit to determine the absorbances due to the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin,\n&%Bone, &%Muscle, &%FatTissue, and, in most cases, nail polish.
