  "definition": "A cell wall is a structural\nlayer surrounding some types of &%Cells, just outside the\n&%CellMembrane. It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. It\nprovides the cell with both structural support and protection, and\nalso acts as a filtering mechanism. Cell walls are present in most\nprokaryotes (&%ProkaryoticCell) (except a mollicute &%Bacterium), in\nalgae (&%Alga), fungi (&%Fungus) and (&%EukaryoticCell) including\n&%Plants but are absent in &%Animals. A major function is to act as\npressure vessels, preventing over_expansion of the cell when &%Water\nenters. The composition of cell walls varies between species and may\ndepend on cell type and developmental stage. The primary cell wall of\nland plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose,\nhemicelluloses and pectin. Often, other polymers such as lignin,\nsuberin or cutin are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls.\nAlgae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides\nsuch as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In\nbacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls\nof (&%ArchaealCell) have various compositions, and may be formed of\nglycoprotein S_layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides. Fungi\npossess cell walls made of the N_acetylglucosamine polymer chitin.\nUnusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic silica. [from\nWikipedia]",
