  "definition": "Bile, or gall, is a dark-green-to-yellowish-brown fluid produced by the liver of\nmost vertebrates that aids the digestion of lipids in the small intestine. In &%Humans, bile is produced continuously\nby the &%Liver (liver bile) and stored and concentrated in the &%Gallbladder. After &%Eating, this stored bile is\ndischarged into the duodenum.\nThe composition of hepatic bile is (97\u201398)% water, 0.7% bile salts, 0.2% bilirubin, 0.51% fats (cholesterol,\nfatty acids, and lecithin), and 200 meq/l inorganic salts. The two main pigments of bile are bilirubin,\nwhich is yellow, and its oxidised form biliverdin, which is green. When mixed, they are responsible for the\nbrown color of &%Feces. About 400 to 800 millilitres of bile is produced per day in adult human beings.[from Wikipedia]",
