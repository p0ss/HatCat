  "definition": "Gaslighting is a\ncolloquialism that is loosely defined as making someone question their\nreality. The term is also used informally to describe someone (a\n'gaslighter') who persistently puts forth a false narrative which\nleads another person (or a group of people) to doubt their own\nperceptions to the extent that they become disoriented and distressed.\nThis dynamic is generally only possible when the audience is\nvulnerable such as in unequal power relationships or when the audience\nis fearful of the losses associated with challenging the false\nnarrative. Gaslighting is not necessarily malicious or intentional,\nalthough in some cases it is. [from Wikipedia]",
