  "definition": "Mucus is a slippery aqueous\nsecretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes. It is typically\nproduced from cells found in &%MucousGlands, although it may also\noriginate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous\ncells. It is a viscous colloid containing inorganic &%Salts,\nantimicrobial &%Enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins (especially\nIgA), and glycoproteins such as lactoferrin and mucins, which are\nproduced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal\nglands. Mucus serves to protect &%Epithelial cells in the linings of the\nrespiratory, digestive, and urogenital systems, and structures in the\nvisual and auditory systems from pathogenic fungi (&%Fungus), bacteria (&%Bacterium) and\n&%Viruses. Most of the mucus in the body is produced in the\ngastrointestinal tract.",
