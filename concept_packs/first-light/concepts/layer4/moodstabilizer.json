  "definition": "A mood stabilizer is a\npsychiatric medication used to treat mood disorders characterized by\nintense and sustained mood shifts, such as bipolar disorder and the\nbipolar type of schizoaffective disorder. Mood stabilizers are best\nknown for the treatment of bipolar disorder, preventing mood shifts to\nmania (or hypomania) and depression. Mood stabilizers are also used in\nschizoaffective disorder when it is the bipolar type. The term\n'mood stabilizer' does not describe a mechanism, but rather an effect.\nMore precise terminology based on pharmacology is used to further\nclassify these agents.[from Wikipedia]",
