  "definition": "&%KatabaticWind is a downslope wind \ncaused by the flow of an elevated, high-density air mass into a lower-density air mass \nbelow under the force of gravity. A katabatic wind originates from the difference of \ndensity of two air masses located above a slope. This density difference usually comes \nfrom temperature difference, even if humidity may also play a role. Schematically katabatic \nwinds can be divided into two types for which the mechanisms are slightly different: \nthe katabatic winds due to radiative cooling (the most common) and the fall winds.[Wikipedia]",
