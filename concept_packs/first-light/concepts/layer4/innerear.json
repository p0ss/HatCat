  "definition": "The inner ear is the innermost part\nof the vertebrate ear. In vertebrates, the inner ear is mainly responsible for sound detection and balance.\nIn &%Mammals, it consists of the bony labyrinth, a hollow cavity in the &%TemporalBone of the skull with a\nsystem of passages comprising two main functional parts:\n(1) The cochlea, dedicated to hearing; converting sound pressure patterns from the &%AuditoryCanal into electrochemical\nimpulses which are passed on to the &%Brain via the auditory nerve.\n(2) The vestibular system, dedicated to balance.\nThe inner ear is found in all &%Vertebrates, with substantial variations in form and function. The inner ear is\ninnervated by the eighth cranial nerve in all vertebrates. [from Wikipedia]",
