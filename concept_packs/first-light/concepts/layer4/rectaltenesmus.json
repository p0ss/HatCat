  "definition": "Rectal tenesmus is a\nfeeling of incomplete defecation. It is the sensation of inability or\ndifficulty to empty the bowel at defecation, even if the bowel\ncontents have already been evacuated. Tenesmus indicates the feeling\nof a residue, and is not always correlated with the actual presence of\nresidual fecal matter in the rectum. It is frequently painful and may\nbe accompanied by involuntary straining and other gastrointestinal\nsymptoms. Tenesmus has both a nociceptive and a neuropathic\ncomponent.[from Wikipedia]",
