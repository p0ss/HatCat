  "definition": "In anatomy, the Eustachian tube, also called the auditory tube or pharyngotympanic tube,\nis a tube that links the nasopharynx to the middle ear, of which it is also a part. In adult humans, the\nEustachian tube is approximately 35 mm (1.4 in) long and 3 mm (0.12 in) in diameter. In humans and other tetrapods,\nboth the middle ear and the ear canal are normally filled with air. Unlike the air of the ear canal, however, the\nair of the middle ear is not in direct contact with the atmosphere outside the body; thus, a pressure difference\ncan develop between the atmospheric pressure of the ear canal and the middle ear. Normally, the Eustachian tube\nis collapsed, but it gapes open with swallowing and with positive pressure, allowing the middle ear's pressure\nto adjust to the atmospheric pressure.\nThe Eustachian tube extends from the anterior wall of the middle ear to the lateral wall of the nasopharynx,\napproximately at the level of the inferior nasal concha. It consists of a bony part and a cartilaginous part.\n[from Wikipedia]",
