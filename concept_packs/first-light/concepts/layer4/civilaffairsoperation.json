  "definition": "Civil Affairs Operations\n(CAO). These consist of CA activities and other tasks conducted by CA\nto support commanders conducting CMO.\n(1) Commanders have an inherent responsibility to maintain proper,\nprudent and lawful relations with the indigenous population,\nauthorities, and government within their operational areas. These\nrelations are facilitated through CMO.\n(2) Specialized CMO support is provided by CA personnel assigned as\nstaff who plan, coordinate, and oversee CMO while implementation is\nperformed by other elements of the joint force (i.e., other SOF,\nengineers, health services support, transportation, military police,\nsecurity, and maneuver units).\n(3) CA support to CMO enhances military effectiveness by focusing\nefforts to minimize civilian interference with military operations and\nlimit the adverse impact of military operations on civilian\npopulations and resources. CA give commanders the capability to\ncoordinate and provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance to\nmeet the life-sustaining needs of a civilian population.\n(4) CA activities include, when directed and by operational necessity,\nestablishing and conducting a military government or civil\nadministration within operational areas until civilian authority or\ngovernment can be restored or transitioned to other appropriate\nauthorities. These activities are planned and conducted by CA and\ninvolve application of functional specialty expertise in civil sector\ndisciplines normally the responsibility of civil government (see\nFigure II-3).\n(5) CA operations are predominantly joint, interagency, and\nmultinational in nature and are conducted through or with indigenous\npopulations, authorities and institutions, international\norganizations, and NGOs. For more detailed information on CMO and CA\nactivities, see JP 3-57, Joint Doctrine for Civil- Military\nOperations, and JP 3-57.1, Joint Doctrine for Civil Affairs.\n",
