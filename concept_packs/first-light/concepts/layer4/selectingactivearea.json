  "definition": "A &%UserSignifiedAction informing a &%ComputerProgram\nthat the current &%GUIElement with the state &%GUE_ActiveState is selected.  This causes the program\ncontrolling the element to take the action that selecting the element is mapped to.  After the action has\nbeen initiated, unless the action causes a different element to become active or changes the state of the\nelement, the element reverts to &%GUE_ActiveState.\n\nSelecting an &%ActiveArea_Submitting causes a &%SubmitAction (of the type associated with the active area)\nto take place.  What is actually submitted may depend upon the state of associated active areas.  However,\nif the active area is a &%HypertextLink, &%MenuItem, or dedicated &%GUIButton the submission may not be\nstate dependent.\n\nAn off_screen element on an active window can be selected by keyboard action: tabbing to it to make it\nactive and typing the Enter/Return key.",
