  "definition": "A &%FohnWind is a type of dry, relatively warm downslope wind \nin the lee of a mountain range. It is a rain shadow wind that results from the subsequent adiabatic warming \nof air that has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes. As a consequence of the different adiabatic \nlapse rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations \non the windward slopes.[Wikipedia]",
