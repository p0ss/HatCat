  "opposite_reasoning": "Firing is the strongest semantic opposite to Hiring. It represents the direct reversal of the employment/engagement relationship - where Hiring establishes a contractual relationship for performance or work, Firing terminates it. This binary opposition is clear, well-understood, and exists robustly in both WordNet and SUMO. For Fisher-LDA concept axes, this provides maximum separation: \u03bc(Hiring) - \u03bc(Firing) will capture the dimension of employment status changes. While this may have moderate utility for AI safety monitoring (detecting when systems discuss employment changes), it's a strong, clean opposition that will create a reliable concept axis."
