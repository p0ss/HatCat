  "opposite_reasoning": "BaseballBase is a highly specific sports equipment concept without natural antonyms. Among available options, OutOfBounds provides the strongest semantic opposition within the sports domain: valid scoring positions vs. invalid play areas. This complementary relationship (in-bounds vs. out-of-bounds) offers meaningful separation for Fisher-LDA while maintaining contextual relevance. While this opposition has moderate steering utility for AI safety, it's the most coherent pairing for this domain-specific concept. The Physical-Abstract opposition scores higher on strength but loses domain coherence."
