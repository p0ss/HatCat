  "opposite_reasoning": "EngineShutdown provides the strongest binary opposition to EngineCranking: it represents the complementary end-state process (turning off) to the start-state process (turning on). This creates a clean semantic axis for Fisher-LDA where cranking and shutdown are maximally separated in concept space. While this may have limited direct AI safety implications, it provides robust opposition for understanding process initiation vs termination, which could generalize to broader concepts of starting/stopping actions. The term likely exists in SUMO's vehicle/machinery domain."
