  "opposite_reasoning": "While Badger has no direct antonym (it's a specific biological entity), Bird provides the best practical opposite for Fisher-LDA purposes. It offers: (1) clear taxonomic mutual exclusivity at the class level, (2) high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, (3) sufficient semantic distance for effective centroid separation, and (4) conceptual clarity. Fish offers slightly stronger opposition but Bird is more commonly used in ontological work. Plant and AbstractEntity offer stronger opposition but may be too distant for practical steering utility - we want opposites that are intelligibly related but categorically distinct. For a specific animal concept like Badger, staying within the animal kingdom but choosing a different class provides the best balance of opposition strength and practical utility."
