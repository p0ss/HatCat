  "opposite_reasoning": "Oxygen provides the strongest semantic opposition to CarbonDioxide based on their complementary roles in biological and atmospheric processes. They form a natural pair in the respiration-photosynthesis cycle where one is consumed and the other produced. This complementary relationship creates clear distributional separation in concept space. While not a true antonym, it represents the most meaningful and well-defined opposition for a chemical substance. Both concepts are well-established in WordNet and SUMO, ensuring availability."
