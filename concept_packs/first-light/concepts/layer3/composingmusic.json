  "opposite_reasoning": "PerformingMusic is the best opposite because: (1) It represents a clear complementary process within the music domain - composition is the creative authorship phase while performance is the interpretive execution phase; (2) These are functionally distinct and often temporally separated activities; (3) High availability in both WordNet and SUMO increases reliability; (4) Strong semantic distance while maintaining domain coherence provides good Fisher-LDA steering without introducing random noise; (5) The composer-performer distinction is well-established in music theory and practice. While not a true antonym, it provides the strongest complementary opposition that's actually useful for concept space navigation."
