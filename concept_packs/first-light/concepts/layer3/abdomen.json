  "opposite_reasoning": "Head is the best available opposite for Abdomen because: (1) Both are major anatomical body regions in vertebrates with complementary positions on the body axis, (2) They represent functionally distinct regions (cognitive/sensory vs digestive/reproductive), (3) Both concepts reliably exist in WordNet and SUMO, (4) The opposition is semantically meaningful for anatomical concept space separation. However, this is a weak opposition overall - anatomical body parts don't have strong natural antonyms. The opposition_strength is moderate (6/10) because while they are distinct regions, they're not mutually exclusive or truly opposite in the way good/evil or hot/cold are. For AI safety steering utility, this pairing has limited value (3/10) as anatomical distinctions are rarely relevant to deception detection or alignment monitoring."
