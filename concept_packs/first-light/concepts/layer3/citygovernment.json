  "opposite_reasoning": "NationalGovernment provides the strongest taxonomic opposition within the government hierarchy. It offers clear scalar distinction (local vs national jurisdiction), high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and useful semantic separation for Fisher-LDA steering. While not a true antonym, it captures meaningful dimensional contrast in governance scope and authority. This is preferable to Anarchy (which may be too philosophically distant) or cross-category opposites (PrivateCorporation, Family) which introduce confounding dimensions. The city-vs-nation axis is clean, well-defined, and likely to have strong distributional separation in embeddings."
