  "opposite_reasoning": "OrganicFood provides the strongest conceptual opposition to DDT for Fisher-LDA purposes. It captures multiple opposition dimensions: synthetic vs natural, toxic vs safe, banned chemical vs promoted agricultural practice, environmental harm vs environmental protection. This opposition is culturally salient (organic movement arose partly from DDT concerns), likely to have distinct distributional patterns in text, and useful for AI safety monitoring around topics of harm, regulation, and public health. While 'Medicine' has higher availability, OrganicFood better captures the specific agricultural/environmental/toxicity opposition central to DDT's meaning."
