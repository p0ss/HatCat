  "opposite_reasoning": "FactualRelation provides the strongest semantic opposition to CounterfactualRelation. The core distinction is between hypothetical/contrary-to-fact reasoning ('if X had not happened, Y would not have happened') versus actual/factual dependencies ('X happened and caused Y'). This opposition is crucial for AI safety monitoring as it distinguishes between reality-grounded reasoning and hypothetical/speculative reasoning. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful axis from counterfactual speculation to factual observation. While FactualRelation likely doesn't exist as a formal SUMO term, it should be added to create a coherent conceptual pair - counterfactual reasoning is meaningless without its factual counterpart."
