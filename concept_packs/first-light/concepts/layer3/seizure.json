Outward\neffects vary from uncontrolled shaking movements involving much of the\nbody with loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizure), to shaking\nmovements involving only part of the body with variable levels of\nconsciousness (focal seizure), to a subtle momentary loss of awareness\n(absence seizure). Most of the time these episodes last less than\ntwo minutes and it takes some time to return to normal. Loss of\nbladder control may occur.[from Wikipedia]",
