  "opposite_reasoning": "PsychologicalAttribute provides the strongest opposition for AI safety monitoring purposes. ComputerStatus represents purely computational/machine states, while PsychologicalAttribute represents mental/emotional states of conscious beings. This distinction is crucial for AI alignment: helping systems distinguish between their own operational states and human psychological states. The opposition is strong (8/10), highly relevant for safety applications (8/10), and likely exists in SUMO (9/10). This pairing helps establish concept axes that separate machine-level operations from human-level mental states, which is fundamental for preventing anthropomorphization errors and maintaining appropriate boundaries in AI reasoning."
