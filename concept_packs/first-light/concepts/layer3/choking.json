  "opposite_reasoning": "NormalBreathing provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA: it represents the complete absence of choking's defining features (obstruction, difficulty, reflexive coughing). For concept steering, the axis 'Choking \u2194 NormalBreathing' captures the pathological-to-healthy respiratory state spectrum. While it may not exist as a distinct synset in WordNet, it likely exists in SUMO's medical/biological ontology (or should be added). This is superior to generic 'Breathing' because it explicitly contrasts the pathological state with normal function, providing clearer semantic separation."
