  "opposite_reasoning": "Given the lack of clear domain-specific antonyms for 'BaseballInning', the best Fisher-LDA anchor is a fundamental ontological opposition. PhysicalObject provides the strongest category-level contrast: temporal events/processes vs. concrete spatial entities. This maximizes semantic distance while maintaining conceptual coherence. For AI safety monitoring, this event-object axis could help distinguish between process descriptions and entity references, which is useful for grounding and temporal reasoning. The high availability (definitely in both WordNet and SUMO) ensures practical utility."
