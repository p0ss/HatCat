  "opposite_reasoning": "Command is the strongest practical opposite for Feedback in a control/process management context. While not a traditional antonym, it provides clear complementary opposition: Commands are directives sent TO processes (forward direction), while Feedback is information returned FROM processes (backward direction). This directional complementarity creates a meaningful semantic axis. Command has high availability (likely in both WordNet and SUMO), strong relevance for AI safety monitoring (understanding command-response cycles), and clear conceptual distinction. The Command\u2194Feedback axis would effectively separate concepts related to control initiation vs status reporting, which is valuable for analyzing AI system behavior and communication patterns."
