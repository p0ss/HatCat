  "opposite_reasoning": "PlantProduct provides the strongest complementary opposition to AnimalProduct. Both are biological products, but derived from different kingdoms of life (Animalia vs Plantae). This creates a clean, mutually exclusive taxonomic distinction that maintains the same level of abstraction (manufactured products from living organisms) while providing maximum semantic distance within that domain. The opposition is ontologically sound, likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides clear conceptual boundaries useful for Fisher-LDA axis formation. This is more semantically coherent than jumping to completely different categories like services or abstract concepts."
