  "opposite_reasoning": "Occupation is the strongest opposite for Evacuation because it represents the most direct antonymic relationship: evacuation is the organized departure from a place, while occupation is the organized taking/filling of a place. This binary opposition provides maximum semantic distance for Fisher-LDA centroid separation. The pair captures the fundamental directional opposition (leaving vs. entering/staying) and is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO. For AI safety monitoring, this opposition could be useful for understanding spatial reasoning, movement intentions, and situational awareness in agent behavior."
