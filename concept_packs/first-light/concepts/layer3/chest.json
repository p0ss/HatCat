  "opposite_reasoning": "Chest and Back represent the clearest anatomical opposition - anterior vs posterior surfaces of the torso. This is a well-established complementary pair in anatomy with strong semantic distance. While body part oppositions have limited utility for AI safety/deception detection (steering_utility is low), Back provides the most coherent and defensible opposite for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. The pairing is widely recognized, well-documented in both WordNet and SUMO, and represents a natural binary division of the torso."
