  "opposite_reasoning": "GeographicArea provides the strongest conceptually meaningful opposition - the map vs the territory, representation vs referent. This is a fundamental distinction in semantics and epistemology. It has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and offers good steering utility for distinguishing between abstract representational systems and concrete entities. This opposition is more semantically grounded than the generic abstract\u2194physical divide, while being more available than unstructured information concepts."
