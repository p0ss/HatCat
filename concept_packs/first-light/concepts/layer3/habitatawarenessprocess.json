  "opposite_reasoning": "While HabitatUnawarenessProcess would be the strongest semantic opposite, it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies. AbstractReasoning provides a strong and available alternative that captures the key opposition: reasoning grounded in physical/environmental context vs reasoning divorced from such grounding. This distinction is crucial for AI safety monitoring - detecting when systems reason about their deployment context vs engaging in pure abstraction. AbstractReasoning likely exists in WordNet/SUMO as a general cognitive process category, making it practically implementable. The Physical\u2194Abstract opposition is fundamental in ontology and highly relevant for detecting situational awareness in AI systems."
