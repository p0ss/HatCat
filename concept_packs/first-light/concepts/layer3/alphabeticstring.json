  "opposite_reasoning": "NumericString is the strongest complementary opposite because it represents the most fundamental partition in character string types: letters vs. numbers. This creates a clean, interpretable axis for Fisher-LDA where alphabetic strings cluster at one pole and numeric strings at the other. The opposition is clear, mutually exclusive, and semantically meaningful. While this isn't a traditional antonym (alphabetic strings don't have moral or evaluative opposites), it's the most useful complementary concept for creating a discriminative axis. NumericString likely exists in SUMO as a parallel construct to AlphabeticString and should definitely be included in the ontology layers."
