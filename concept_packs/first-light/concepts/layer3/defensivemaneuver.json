  "opposite_reasoning": "OffensiveManeuver is the ideal opposite for DefensiveManeuver because: (1) It maintains parallel abstraction level and structure - both are maneuvers/tactical operations; (2) It represents the canonical binary opposition in military doctrine (offense vs defense); (3) It creates a clean semantic axis for Fisher-LDA where defensive actions cluster on one side and offensive actions on the other; (4) High likelihood of existing in both WordNet and SUMO as it's a fundamental military concept; (5) For AI safety applications, distinguishing defensive vs offensive intent/actions is valuable for monitoring aggressive vs protective behaviors."
