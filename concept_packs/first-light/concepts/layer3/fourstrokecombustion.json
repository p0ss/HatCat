  "opposite_reasoning": "While FourStrokeCombustion is a highly specific technical process without a natural antonym, Cooling provides the strongest semantic opposition by capturing the fundamental thermodynamic contrast: heat generation/energy release vs heat removal/energy dissipation. This is more generalizable than stroke-specific opposites (IntakeStroke, ExhaustStroke, Compression) which are complementary phases rather than true opposites. Cooling also has higher availability in both WordNet and SUMO, making it more practical for Fisher-LDA anchoring. For AI safety applications, this concept pair has limited direct utility (low steering_utility scores across all candidates) as it's domain-specific to mechanical engineering rather than behavioral/alignment concerns."
