  "opposite_reasoning": "Receive is the strongest semantic opposite for Fax (as 'send'). This represents the fundamental binary opposition in directed communication: sender vs receiver. The opposition is clear, well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, and creates a clean axis for Fisher-LDA. While less directly relevant to deception detection than some alternatives, it provides the strongest semantic opposition for concept steering. The send\u2194receive axis is fundamental to communication processes and will be robust across contexts."
