  "opposite_reasoning": "Lead provides the strongest opposition to BalsaWood on the defining characteristic that makes balsa wood notable: its extreme lightness. Lead is one of the densest common materials (11.34 g/cm\u00b3) while balsa wood is one of the lightest structural materials (~0.16 g/cm\u00b3), creating a ~70x density ratio. This maximizes semantic distance on the most salient feature axis. While IronWood would be more taxonomically parallel (both being woods), Lead creates stronger Fisher-LDA separation due to greater property contrast. For AI safety applications, material property opposites have limited direct utility for deception detection, but provide good general concept space calibration."
