  "opposite_reasoning": "GameGoal represents the endpoint/destination in game space (where players advance toward), making StartingLine the most natural complementary opposite as the origin/beginning point. This opposition captures a fundamental spatial and functional complementarity within game contexts: destination vs. origin, end vs. beginning, target vs. source. While StartingLine may not exist in current SUMO layers, it's a legitimate concept in sports/games domains and would create meaningful Fisher-LDA axes for distinguishing directional and goal-oriented concepts. The opposition is stronger than category-level contrasts (GamePiece) and more principled than arbitrary distributional distances."
