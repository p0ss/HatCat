  "opposite_reasoning": "Forestock is a highly specific physical component of a firearm. It lacks a true semantic antonym, but Buttstock provides the best complementary opposition as the anatomically opposite part of the same weapon system (front vs rear portions of gunstock). This creates meaningful spatial and functional opposition while maintaining semantic coherence within the weapon domain. For Fisher-LDA, this pairing would capture the 'front-vs-back' dimension of weapon components. If the goal is broader ontological separation, AbstractObject would be stronger, but Buttstock provides more interpretable and domain-coherent opposition."
