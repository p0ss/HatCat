  "opposite_reasoning": "Face is a specific anatomical body part without a true antonym. Among the candidates, 'Back' (specifically back of head/body) provides the most coherent spatial opposition. It maintains anatomical relevance while offering clear front-back directionality that would create meaningful separation in Fisher-LDA space. While not a strong semantic opposite for AI safety purposes, it's the most defensible choice for a physical body part concept. The face-back opposition is intuitive and well-represented in language/perception."
