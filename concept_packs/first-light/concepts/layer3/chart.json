  "opposite_reasoning": "RawData provides the strongest functional and semantic opposition to Chart. Charts are processed, visualized representations of quantities, while raw data is unprocessed, unvisualized information. This opposition is meaningful for AI safety monitoring because it captures the transformation from unstructured information to structured representation - relevant for understanding how AI systems process and present information. The pair represents opposite ends of the data-to-visualization pipeline, making it excellent for Fisher-LDA separation. This has practical utility for distinguishing between data processing stages and understanding when AI presents information vs. raw data."
