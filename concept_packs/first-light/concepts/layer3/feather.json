  "opposite_reasoning": "Scale represents the strongest semantic opposition to Feather from a taxonomic/biological perspective. Both are specialized integumentary structures that define major vertebrate classes (birds vs reptiles/fish), are mutually exclusive, and serve analogous functions (protection, thermoregulation) through completely different structural mechanisms. This provides clear conceptual separation for Fisher-LDA anchoring. While this opposition has limited direct utility for AI safety/deception detection, it represents the most semantically coherent opposite for the biological entity 'Feather'. Alternative: Stone provides maximum physical property contrast if material opposition is preferred over taxonomic."
