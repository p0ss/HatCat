  "opposite_reasoning": "IntuitiveCognition provides the strongest semantic opposition for AI safety purposes. CSReasoningProcess represents systematic, verifiable, explainable thinking (algorithms, formal verification, debugging) - exactly what we want from aligned AI systems. Intuitive cognition represents opaque, pattern-matching, non-verifiable reasoning - a safety concern when AI systems can't explain their reasoning. This axis captures the explainable\u2194opaque reasoning dimension critical for AI alignment. The systematic-logical vs. holistic-intuitive distinction is fundamental to cognitive science and highly relevant for monitoring whether AI engages in transparent reasoning vs. black-box decision-making. While IntuitiveCognition may need to be added to layers if missing, it's a natural SUMO concept likely to exist."
