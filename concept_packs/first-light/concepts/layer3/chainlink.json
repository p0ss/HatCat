  "opposite_reasoning": "ChainLink is a highly specific, concrete manufactured physical object at Layer 3. For Fisher-LDA concept steering, the most useful opposition is between concrete physical artifacts and abstract/intangible concepts. This provides maximum semantic distance while remaining ontologically coherent. IntangibleObject is well-established in SUMO and provides a clear physical\u2194abstract opposition that should create strong separability in embedding space. While this opposition has limited direct AI safety implications, it provides robust geometric separation for the concept axis. The other candidates are weaker: ContinuousObject is conceptually sound but less established; NaturalObject and FluidSubstance provide good opposition but less maximal separation; BiologicalLivingObject introduces animate/inanimate which is less central to the chain link concept."
