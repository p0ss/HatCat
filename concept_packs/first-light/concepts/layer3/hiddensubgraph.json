  "opposite_reasoning": "ExplicitNetworkStructure provides the strongest semantic opposition to HiddenSubgraph along the critical dimensions: hidden\u2194explicit, obscure\u2194obvious, covert\u2194overt. For AI safety monitoring, this opposition is highly valuable for detecting deceptive network structures, backdoors, and covert communications. The concept captures both the visibility aspect (hidden\u2192explicit) and the structural aspect (maintains NetworkStructure domain). While it doesn't currently exist in standard ontologies, it represents a principled opposite that should be added to the layers for symmetric concept representation. The opposition creates a clear axis: networks whose structure/purpose is deliberately obscured vs. networks whose structure/purpose is openly documented and visible."
