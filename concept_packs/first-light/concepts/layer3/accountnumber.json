  "opposite_reasoning": "While AccountNumber lacks a direct antonym, PhysicalObject provides the strongest ontological opposition available in existing SUMO/WordNet. The abstract\u2194physical distinction is fundamental and well-established. For AI safety monitoring, this axis would help distinguish between abstract symbolic identifiers and concrete physical entities. AnonymousIdentifier would be theoretically superior for capturing the identified\u2194anonymous dimension (highly relevant for privacy/security monitoring), but its low availability is problematic. PhysicalObject offers high confidence and immediate availability, making it the pragmatic choice for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring."
