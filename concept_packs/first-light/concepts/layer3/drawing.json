  "opposite_reasoning": "Erasing provides the strongest semantic opposition to Drawing as it represents the direct functional inverse: drawing creates/adds visual marks while erasing removes/subtracts them. Both are intentional processes in the artistic domain, making them natural complements. This opposition is useful for Fisher-LDA as it clearly separates additive creative processes from subtractive ones. While not directly related to deception/alignment, it provides a clean conceptual axis for distinguishing creation from removal actions. The opposition is intuitive, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and would be valuable for understanding artistic and creative processes."
