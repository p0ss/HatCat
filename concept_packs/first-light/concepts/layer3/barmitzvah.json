  "opposite_reasoning": "Bar Mitzvah as a specific religious coming-of-age ceremony lacks a direct antonym, but Excommunication provides the strongest semantic opposition along the inclusion\u2194exclusion dimension within religious community context. Bar Mitzvah represents formal entry and acceptance into religious adulthood and community responsibilities, while Excommunication represents formal expulsion and rejection from that same community. This captures a meaningful opposition (initiation vs expulsion, inclusion vs exclusion, acceptance vs rejection) that should provide useful Fisher-LDA separation. While not perfect, it's more semantically meaningful than lifecycle opposites (Funeral) or gender complements (BatMitzvah), and more specific than abstract sacred/secular distinctions."
