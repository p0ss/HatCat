  "opposite_reasoning": "FaceToFaceCommunication provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. It represents the clearest complementary category to artifact-mediated communication: direct physical presence vs. technological mediation. This distinction is semantically rich (captures spatial co-presence, bandwidth differences, synchronicity), likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO, and highly relevant for AI safety applications where distinguishing communication modalities matters. While 'UnmediatedCommunication' is theoretically purer as a logical negation, FaceToFaceCommunication is more concrete, more likely to have corpus representation, and provides better distributional separation for LDA centroid estimation."
