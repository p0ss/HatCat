  "opposite_reasoning": "GolfHole is a highly specific physical artifact with limited semantic opposition options. Mountain provides the strongest geometric/topological opposition (depression vs elevation, concave vs convex, low point vs high point) while being a well-established concept in both WordNet and SUMO. This opposition captures meaningful spatial semantics useful for LDA separation. GolfTee provides domain-coherent opposition but weaker semantic distance. Sky and AbstractEntity are viable alternatives but less concrete. For AI safety steering, this specific domain has minimal relevance, so we prioritize clear semantic structure over safety utility."
