  "opposite_reasoning": "FieldOfLaw represents a specific type of academic/professional field focused on normative, interpretive reasoning about human institutions. NaturalScience provides the strongest semantic opposition as it represents the complementary domain of empirical, descriptive investigation of natural phenomena. This captures a fundamental epistemic divide: normative vs. descriptive, interpretive vs. empirical, social/human-focused vs. nature-focused. For Fisher-LDA, this opposition would help create an axis distinguishing abstract normative reasoning from empirical scientific investigation. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it provides a clean conceptual boundary useful for distinguishing types of knowledge domains and reasoning modes."
