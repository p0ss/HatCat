  "opposite_reasoning": "AmphibiousReconnaissanceUnit is a highly specialized military entity. While it lacks a direct antonym, the military\u2194civilian distinction provides the strongest semantic opposition for this concept. CivilianGroup represents non-militarized, non-combat organizational entities, creating a clear taxonomic boundary. This opposition is: (1) semantically robust - military vs civilian is a fundamental social distinction, (2) ontologically valid - both are organized groups but with mutually exclusive functions, (3) readily available in both WordNet and SUMO, and (4) provides useful negative anchoring for Fisher-LDA by contrasting military reconnaissance characteristics (combat-readiness, tactical operations, intelligence gathering) with civilian organizational characteristics. PeacekeepingUnit was considered but represents a weaker opposition as it's still within the military domain."
