  "opposite_reasoning": "Keel provides the strongest opposition within the maritime domain, maintaining semantic coherence while establishing clear vertical and functional opposition. BoatDeck is where people walk and access the vessel (top, accessible platform), while Keel is the foundational bottom structure. This within-domain opposition is more meaningful for Fisher-LDA than jumping to abstract concepts or unrelated categories. The opposition is intuitive, both concepts exist in standard ontologies, and they represent complementary extremes of ship architecture."
