  "opposite_reasoning": "Endoskeleton is the ideal opposite for Exoskeleton. This is a textbook anatomical antonym pair representing two mutually exclusive evolutionary solutions to the same biological problem (structural support). The opposition is: (1) Binary and clear-cut - animals have one or the other, not both as primary skeletal systems; (2) Semantically strong - internal vs external is a fundamental spatial opposition; (3) Well-established in biological taxonomy and ontology. While this pairing has moderate steering utility for AI safety (not directly related to deception/alignment), it provides a clean, reliable opposition for Fisher-LDA that will help the model learn spatial and structural distinctions. The concept almost certainly exists in both WordNet and SUMO given its fundamental importance in biology."
