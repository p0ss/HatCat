  "opposite_reasoning": "Vulnerability is the strongest semantic opposite for Armor because it captures the functional essence of what armor opposes: susceptibility to harm. While Armor is a physical artifact and Vulnerability is an abstract state/attribute, this Physical\u2194Abstract pairing creates a strong conceptual axis for Fisher-LDA. The protection-vulnerability spectrum is semantically clear, would be useful for safety monitoring contexts (systems protecting against vulnerabilities), and both concepts should exist in standard ontologies. The entity-attribute opposition provides good separation in semantic space."
