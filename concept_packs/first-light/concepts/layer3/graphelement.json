  "opposite_reasoning": "GraphElement lacks a natural direct antonym, as it's a specialized mathematical/structural concept. Among the candidates, PhysicalObject provides the strongest and most reliable opposition: (1) Abstract vs Physical is a fundamental ontological distinction well-established in SUMO; (2) High availability - PhysicalObject is a core SUMO concept with extensive WordNet coverage; (3) Clean semantic separation - graph elements are pure mathematical abstractions while physical objects are concrete instantiations in spacetime; (4) Fisher-LDA utility - creates a clear axis separating abstract relational structures from concrete physical entities. While this opposition has modest steering utility for AI safety specifically, it provides reliable semantic grounding. The abstract-physical axis is interpretable and could help distinguish reasoning about formal structures vs physical world modeling."
