  "opposite_reasoning": "Disclosure provides the strongest semantic opposition to Espionage along the critical dimension of information concealment vs revelation. For AI safety monitoring, this opposition is highly valuable as it captures the spectrum from covert intelligence gathering to transparent information sharing. Disclosure likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available. It provides excellent Fisher-LDA separation: espionage behavior clusters around secrecy, surveillance, and covert operations, while disclosure clusters around revelation, transparency, and openness. This axis is directly relevant to detecting deceptive AI behavior and monitoring alignment."
