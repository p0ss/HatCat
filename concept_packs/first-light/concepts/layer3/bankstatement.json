  "opposite_reasoning": "BankStatement is a specialized type of written, formal, institutional communication/document. OralCommunication provides the strongest practical opposition on the written/spoken dimension while maintaining relevance to communication and information transfer. This opposition is more semantically coherent than jumping to completely unrelated categories (like natural landmarks), and more likely to be useful for Fisher-LDA steering as it captures a fundamental modality distinction. The concept exists in both WordNet and SUMO with high confidence, making it readily available. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between formal documentation and informal communication could be relevant for detecting attempts to obscure institutional accountability or formal records."
