  "opposite_reasoning": "While AircraftMovement lacks a direct antonym, 'Stasis' provides the strongest semantic opposition as the fundamental opposite of any movement or dynamic process. It represents zero motion, equilibrium, and immobility - the conceptual negation of positional change. This is philosophically sound (movement vs. non-movement) and highly likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making it immediately usable. For Fisher-LDA purposes, the \u03bc+ (movement) - \u03bc- (stasis) axis would effectively capture the dynamic-vs-static dimension. If more domain-specific opposition is needed, 'AircraftStationaryState' should be added as a specialized alternative, but 'Stasis' provides better availability and broader applicability."
