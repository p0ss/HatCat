  "opposite_reasoning": "DisconnectedGraph is the strongest semantic opposite for ConnectedComponent. A connected component represents maximal connectivity within a subset, while a disconnected graph represents the absence of such connectivity - multiple components with no paths between them. This opposition captures the fundamental property of connectivity vs disconnectivity in graph theory. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis: connected/cohesive structures vs disconnected/fragmented structures. While AI safety relevance is moderate (connectivity patterns appear in information flow, network trust, causal chains), this is the most mathematically and semantically rigorous opposite."
