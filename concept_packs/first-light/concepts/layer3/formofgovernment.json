  "opposite_reasoning": "FormOfGovernment lacks a clear direct antonym because it's a descriptive attribute category rather than a value-laden concept. NaturalProcess provides the strongest semantic opposition by contrasting human-designed institutional structures with spontaneous natural phenomena. This captures the essence of what FormOfGovernment is NOT: it's not natural, not spontaneous, not undesigned. For Fisher-LDA, this should create a meaningful axis distinguishing intentional social organization from natural processes. While Anarchy might seem intuitive, it's actually included within FormOfGovernment in SUMO (as noted in the definition), making it unsuitable as an external opposite. NaturalProcess offers cleaner categorical separation."
