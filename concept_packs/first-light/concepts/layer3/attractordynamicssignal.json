  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the strongest conceptual opposite because it directly addresses the contrast stated in the definition itself: 'rather than one-shot mapping'. DirectMappingSignal captures the essence of computation without iterative convergence, without trajectory structures, and without basin-of-attraction dynamics. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between systems that converge iteratively (potentially with deliberation, planning, or deceptive trajectory shaping) versus those that perform direct transformations is highly relevant. The opposition is clean, mathematically grounded, and semantically maximal."
