  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the clearest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA steering. It represents the binary opposition between creating WMDs (threat creation) and eliminating WMDs (threat reduction). For AI safety applications, distinguishing between concepts related to weapons creation vs. destruction is critical for monitoring potentially dangerous content generation. The opposition captures both the physical process reversal (build vs. dismantle) and the strategic/ethical dimension (proliferation vs. disarmament). While it may not exist as a specific WordNet synset, it is highly likely to exist in SUMO given the ontology's coverage of military and weapons-related processes."
