  "opposite_reasoning": "Afforestation provides the strongest semantic opposition to Desertification. Both are ecological transformation processes but in opposite directions: Desertification transforms habitable land into desert (degradation), while Afforestation transforms non-forested land into forest (enhancement). This complementary process pair represents clear directional opposition along the dimension of land fertility and ecological productivity. The opposition is ecologically coherent and likely well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. For Fisher-LDA steering, this pair would create a meaningful axis representing land degradation vs. land restoration/enhancement."
