  "opposite_reasoning": "Abundance provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. ConservationStatus fundamentally tracks the concern about population scarcity/endangerment, while Abundance represents plentiful, thriving populations. This creates a clear bipolar axis (scarce/threatened \u2194 abundant/secure) that is conceptually clean and likely well-represented in embedding spaces. While 'Extinction' is tempting as the terminal state, it's more of an endpoint than an opposite status. Abundance better captures the positive pole of the conservation spectrum and is more likely to have rich semantic associations in text corpora (abundant wildlife, thriving populations, etc.) that will create useful Fisher-LDA separation."
