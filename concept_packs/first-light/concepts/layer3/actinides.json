  "opposite_reasoning": "NobleGas provides the strongest semantic opposition within the same ontological category (chemical elements). The contrast between highly reactive/radioactive metals and inert/stable non-metals maximizes chemical distance while maintaining taxonomic coherence. This creates a clean Fisher-LDA axis: reactive-radioactive-metallic \u2194 inert-stable-nonmetallic. Noble gases likely exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making this practical for implementation."
