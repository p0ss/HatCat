  "opposite_reasoning": "Believing is the strongest opposite for Doubting as both are fundamental DoxasticAttitudes in SUMO's ontology. They represent the clearest binary opposition in epistemic states: accepting a proposition as true with certainty versus treating it as uncertain with instability. This pair is ideal for Fisher-LDA because it captures the core dimension of epistemic confidence. For AI safety, distinguishing between doubt and belief states is crucial for monitoring model confidence, detecting potential deception (where false certainty may be expressed), and understanding alignment (where appropriate epistemic humility matters). The pair likely already exists in SUMO as complementary doxastic attitudes."
