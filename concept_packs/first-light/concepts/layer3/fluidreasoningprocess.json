  "opposite_reasoning": "DiscreteReasoningProcess is the strongest complement because: (1) It directly contrasts the continuous/flowing nature of fluid reasoning with discrete/step-wise processing, (2) It's conceptually clear and unambiguous - fluid metaphors (waves, flow, propagation) are inherently continuous, while discrete reasoning involves separate computational steps, (3) For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between continuous emergent reasoning and discrete logical steps is valuable for understanding system behavior, (4) It has higher confidence than 'Rigid' (which is more about flexibility/adaptability) and is more specific than 'Structured' or 'Algorithmic'. The continuous-discrete axis is a fundamental dimension in cognitive science and AI."
