  "opposite_reasoning": "Vacuum provides the strongest complementary opposition to Atmosphere. Where atmosphere represents the presence of a gaseous envelope, vacuum represents the absence of matter. This is a physically meaningful, mutually exclusive relationship that creates clear semantic distance. In the context of celestial bodies and space, these concepts occupy opposite ends of the matter-density spectrum. While not directly relevant to AI safety deception detection, it provides robust geometric separation for Fisher-LDA axes and represents a genuine ontological opposition that exists in both WordNet and SUMO."
