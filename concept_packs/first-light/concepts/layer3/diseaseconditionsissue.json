  "opposite_reasoning": "This provides the strongest conceptual opposition within the healthcare domain context. DiseaseConditionsIssue represents reactive, problem-focused health topics (pathology, dysfunction, treatment needs), while HealthWellnessPromotion represents proactive, optimization-focused health topics (prevention, enhancement, vitality). This complementary pair creates a meaningful axis for distinguishing health-related content by orientation (problem vs. optimization). For Fisher-LDA purposes, this gives clear semantic distance while maintaining domain coherence. The opposition is stronger than OptimalHealthState (which is more of a state vs. topic category mismatch) and more specific than generic importance-based oppositions."
