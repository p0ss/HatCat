  "opposite_reasoning": "CalmSea provides the strongest semantic opposition to HeavySurf while maintaining high availability in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. It represents a clear spectrum opposite: HeavySurf = high wave energy/turbulence vs CalmSea = low wave energy/minimal disturbance. This opposition is natural for Fisher-LDA as it creates a clear axis along wave intensity. While steering utility for AI safety is low (these are meteorological/oceanographic concepts with limited relevance to deception/alignment), the opposition itself is semantically robust and well-defined in the domain."
