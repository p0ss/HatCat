  "opposite_reasoning": "Cornea is a highly specific anatomical entity with no direct antonym. For Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring, the most useful opposition is at the fundamental ontological level: Physical vs. Abstract. This provides maximum semantic distance while maintaining conceptual coherence. 'Abstract' is well-established in both SUMO and WordNet, making it reliable for concept steering. While this opposition has limited direct relevance to AI safety tasks like deception detection, it provides strong distributional separation for general concept space organization. Alternative 'Artifact' (natural vs. artificial) is also strong but slightly less fundamental than the Physical/Abstract distinction."
