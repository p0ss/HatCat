  "opposite_reasoning": "LandlockedArea provides the strongest available opposition to ArchipelagicArea. The core semantic opposition is clear: archipelagic regions are defined by water surrounding and connecting land fragments, while landlocked areas are characterized by complete separation from oceanic water bodies. This creates a meaningful complementary relationship along the water-accessibility dimension. While ContinentalInterior might be slightly stronger semantically, LandlockedArea has better availability in existing ontologies and provides sufficient opposition strength (8/10) for Fisher-LDA anchoring. The concept is geographically meaningful and likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO."
