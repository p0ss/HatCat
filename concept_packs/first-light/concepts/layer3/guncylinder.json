  "opposite_reasoning": "Magazine is the best opposite for GunCylinder because: (1) Both are ammunition feeding mechanisms in firearms, making them taxonomically related but functionally mutually exclusive; (2) They represent different design solutions to the same problem (multiple-shot capacity); (3) Magazine has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO; (4) The opposition is semantically meaningful - revolvers use cylinders, semi-automatics use magazines; (5) For Fisher-LDA, this provides clear differentiation within the firearm component space. While AbstractEntity has stronger ontological opposition, Magazine provides more useful semantic granularity at the appropriate level of abstraction for a Layer 3 concept."
