  "opposite_reasoning": "CurrencyCodeMap represents a highly abstract meta-level concept (a structural mapping between symbolic representations). It has no natural antonym since it's a technical ontological term. PhysicalEntity provides the strongest semantic opposition by maximizing distance along the abstract-concrete axis - the most fundamental ontological distinction. This is maximally useful for Fisher-LDA as it creates a clear axis from abstract symbolic structures to concrete physical objects. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it provides a stable, well-defined axis for distinguishing abstract relational concepts from concrete entities."
