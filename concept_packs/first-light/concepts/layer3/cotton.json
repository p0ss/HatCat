  "opposite_reasoning": "Metal provides the strongest multi-dimensional opposition to Cotton across key material properties: organic vs inorganic, soft vs hard, flexible vs rigid, insulating vs conductive, natural fiber vs elemental substance. This creates a robust semantic distance for Fisher-LDA projection. While Cotton itself has limited AI safety relevance, having clear material oppositions helps the system understand categorical distinctions between natural/synthetic, organic/inorganic, and different physical properties - which could be relevant for understanding concept boundaries and avoiding category confusion in safety-critical contexts."
