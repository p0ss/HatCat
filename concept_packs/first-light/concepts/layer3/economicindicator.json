  "opposite_reasoning": "EconomicIndicator lacks a direct antonym, but its core semantic properties (objective, quantifiable, empirical, data-driven) are best opposed by subjective, unmeasured assessments. This opposition captures the objective\u2194subjective distinction which is both semantically coherent and useful for AI safety applications (distinguishing factual metrics from opinions/biases). While SubjectiveAssessment may not exist as a formal SUMO term, the concept is clear and should be added. Fallback to QualitativeAttribute (likely in SUMO) or PersonalExperience (broader but available) provides robust alternatives."
