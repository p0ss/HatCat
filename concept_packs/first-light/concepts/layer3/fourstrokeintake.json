  "opposite_reasoning": "FourStrokeExhaust is the strongest semantic opposite as it represents the complementary phase in the same cyclic process. While intake draws air/fuel IN, exhaust expels combustion products OUT. They are mutually exclusive, temporally sequential phases that form natural opposites in the engine cycle. This provides clear directional opposition (inflow vs outflow) and process complementarity. Although this pairing has limited direct utility for AI safety monitoring (low steering_utility), it represents the most semantically coherent opposition for this technical domain-specific concept."
