  "opposite_reasoning": "Certainty is the most robust choice for opposing DeepUncertaintyConcept. It scores highest on availability (exists in both WordNet and SUMO), has perfect confidence as a standard antonym pair, and maintains very strong opposition strength (9/10). While 'CompleteCertainty' might be slightly more emphatic, 'Certainty' is more universally recognized and likely to exist in the ontologies. For AI safety monitoring, the uncertainty-certainty axis is crucial for detecting confidence calibration, epistemic states, and decision-making under ambiguity. This pairing creates a clear spectrum for Fisher-LDA projection.",
  "definition": "A mental representation of uncertainty so fundamental that probability distributions cannot be assigned."
