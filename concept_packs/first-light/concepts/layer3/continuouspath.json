  "opposite_reasoning": "DiscreteAttribute provides the strongest semantic opposition to ContinuousPath. The continuous-discrete dichotomy is fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and ontology. SUMO likely contains DiscreteAttribute as it's a core distinction in attribute classification. This opposition is clean, well-defined, and maximizes Fisher-LDA separation by contrasting fundamentally different modes of data representation (continuous streams vs discrete units). While TransientPath is mentioned in the definition, DiscreteAttribute captures a deeper, more general opposition that extends beyond just path types to the underlying nature of the attribute itself."
