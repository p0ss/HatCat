  "opposite_reasoning": "BedLinen lacks a true antonym as it's a specific material artifact category. Among candidates, Furniture provides the most coherent opposition within the domestic object domain: soft textile accessories/coverings vs. hard structural furnishings. This opposition captures material properties (soft/fabric vs. hard/wood-metal), functional roles (covering vs. structure), and dependency relationships (accessories FOR furniture vs. furniture itself). While the opposition strength is moderate (6/10), it's the most semantically defensible and has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO. For Fisher-LDA purposes, this creates a useful axis distinguishing textile/soft goods from structural/hard goods in household contexts."
