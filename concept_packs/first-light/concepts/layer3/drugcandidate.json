  "opposite_reasoning": "ApprovedMedicine provides the strongest semantic opposition along the most relevant dimension for DrugCandidate - the drug development lifecycle status. This captures: (1) Potential vs Realized, (2) Testing phase vs Post-approval phase, (3) Hopeful/uncertain vs Validated/certain, (4) In-development vs Market-ready. For Fisher-LDA concept axes, this opposition creates a meaningful vector representing 'development status' or 'validation state' that could be useful for AI safety monitoring when distinguishing between tentative/experimental vs established/proven concepts. The complementary nature (mutually exclusive states in a process) makes this ideal for creating clear separation in concept space."
