  "opposite_reasoning": "Artifact provides the strongest semantic opposition for Ecosystem along the natural\u2194artificial dimension. Ecosystems emerge from natural biological processes and environmental interactions, while artifacts are deliberately constructed objects removed from ecological contexts. This opposition is conceptually clear, exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides meaningful separation for Fisher-LDA steering. For AI safety applications, distinguishing natural systems from artificial constructs can be relevant for understanding how systems reason about intervention, naturalness, and human manipulation of environments."
