  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the strongest opposition for AI safety monitoring. DramaticActing involves pretending/performing a role (inherently involving some form of 'acceptable deception'), while Authenticity represents genuine, unperformed behavior. This axis is directly relevant to deception detection and alignment monitoring - distinguishing between when an agent is 'performing' vs. being genuine. The pretense\u2194genuineness dimension is semantically strong (8/10) and highly useful for steering AI behavior away from deceptive patterns. While the exact SUMO term may need verification, the concept clearly exists in both WordNet (authenticity, genuineness) and philosophical/psychological ontologies."
