  "definition": "&%ElNinoSouthernOscillation, ENSO,\nis a global climate phenomenon that emerges from variation in winds and sea surface \ntemperatures over the tropical &%PacificOcean. It periodically fluctuates between three phases: \nNeutral, La Ni\u00f1a or El Ni\u00f1o. On average, the temperature of the ocean surface in the tropical \nEast Pacific is roughly 8\u201310 \u00b0C (14\u201318 \u00b0F) cooler than in the tropical West Pacific. The sea \nsurface temperature (SST) of the West Pacific northeast of Australia averages around 28\u201330 \u00b0C \n(82\u201386 \u00b0F). SSTs in the East Pacific off the western coast of South America are closer to 20 \u00b0C \n(68 \u00b0F). The warming phase of the sea surface temperature is known as El Ni\u00f1o and the cooling \nphase as La Ni\u00f1a. If the temperature variation from climatology is within 0.5 \u00b0C (0.9 \u00b0F), \nENSO conditions are described as neutral.The ENSO cycle, including both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, \ncauses global changes in temperature and rainfall. Its occurrence is not predictable.[Wikipedia]",

  "opposite_reasoning": "ElNinoSouthernOscillation is a highly specific natural climate process without a clear semantic antonym. Among available options, BiologicalProcess provides the best balance of: (1) likely existence in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, (2) clear categorical distinction (physical/climate vs biological/living systems), (3) sufficient semantic distance for Fisher-LDA separation. While not a strong conceptual opposite, it provides intelligently-distant negative anchor from a different process domain. The opposition is weak for AI safety steering utility since ENSO is domain-specific to climate science rather than behavioral/ethical concepts relevant to deception detection."
