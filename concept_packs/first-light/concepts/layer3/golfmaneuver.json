  "opposite_reasoning": "GolfManeuver lacks a direct antonym because it's a specific sports action. Among the candidates, Stillness provides the strongest semantic opposition by contrasting deliberate physical motion with the absence of motion. This creates a meaningful axis for distinguishing active processes from inactive states. The opposition is clear (motion vs. no-motion), semantically grounded, and likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO. While not directly relevant to AI safety concerns like deception, it provides the most robust conceptual anchor for Fisher-LDA separation of this sports-action concept. InvoluntaryProcess was a close second but is less likely to have strong WordNet representation."
