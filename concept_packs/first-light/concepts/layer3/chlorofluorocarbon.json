  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalSubstance provides the strongest and most conceptually clear opposition to Chlorofluorocarbon along the synthetic/artificial \u2194 natural axis. CFCs are archetypal synthetic industrial chemicals that never occur in nature, making this a robust semantic opposition. The concept is highly likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, providing good availability. While not directly relevant to deception detection, the synthetic-natural distinction is useful for concept steering in domains involving authenticity, artificiality, and human intervention vs natural processes. This opposition creates a clear semantic axis for Fisher-LDA that distinguishes human-made industrial chemicals from naturally-occurring substances."
