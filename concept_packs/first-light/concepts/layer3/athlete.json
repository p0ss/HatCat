  "opposite_reasoning": "While 'Athlete' lacks a traditional antonym, 'Couch Potato' provides the strongest complementary opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. It captures the behavioral, lifestyle, and activity-level contrast that defines the conceptual opposite of an athlete. The term represents sedentary behavior, physical inactivity, and lack of athletic engagement - creating a clear semantic axis. Though informal, it likely exists in WordNet (couch_potato.n.01) and represents a culturally recognized opposite. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish physical activity concepts from sedentary/inactive concepts, useful for understanding context in health, lifestyle, and behavioral domains."
