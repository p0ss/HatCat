  "opposite_reasoning": "GameBoard lacks a direct antonym, but as a concrete physical object, its strongest ontological opposite is AbstractConcept. This provides the clearest physical\u2194abstract axis, which is fundamental to SUMO's ontological structure and maximizes opposition strength (9/10). While steering utility for AI safety is moderate (5/10), this is expected for domain-specific physical objects. The Physical\u2194Abstract distinction is semantically robust and creates clean Fisher-LDA separation. AbstractConcept likely exists in SUMO's upper ontology and should be added to layers if missing, as it's a fundamental ontological category."
