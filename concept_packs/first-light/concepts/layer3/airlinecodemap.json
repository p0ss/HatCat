  "opposite_reasoning": "AirlineCodeMap is a highly abstract concept - a relational mapping system that exists purely as information. PhysicalEntity provides the strongest available opposition as the category of concrete, tangible things. This abstract\u2194physical axis is fundamental in ontology and widely available. While UnmappedEntity would be more semantically precise (mapped\u2194unmapped), it doesn't exist in standard ontologies. PhysicalEntity is a reliable, high-availability opposite that creates meaningful separation in concept space for Fisher-LDA, distinguishing abstract symbolic systems from concrete objects."
