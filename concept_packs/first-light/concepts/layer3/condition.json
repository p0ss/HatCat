  "opposite_reasoning": "Unconditional provides the strongest direct semantic opposition to Condition. It negates the core meaning: Condition = 'circumstances under which X may occur' vs Unconditional = 'X occurs/exists regardless of circumstances'. This opposition is particularly useful for AI safety steering because it captures the distinction between contingent/dependent reasoning vs. absolute/independent reasoning. For Fisher-LDA, this will create a clear axis distinguishing conditional from unconditional statements, which is relevant for understanding when AI systems are reasoning about dependencies vs. making unconditional claims. While 'Unconditional' may not exist as a standalone SUMO term, it's a well-formed concept in WordNet (unconditional.a.01) and should be added to the ontology layers."
