  "opposite_reasoning": "Objectivity is the most pragmatic choice for AI safety monitoring. While MalevolentPrejudice would be a stronger direct antonym, Objectivity has several advantages: (1) definitely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, ensuring availability; (2) addresses the core problematic aspect of 'prejudice' - biased judgment regardless of intent; (3) highly relevant for AI alignment work around bias detection and fairness; (4) creates a meaningful axis from well-intentioned bias to unbiased judgment. The benevolent\u2192malevolent flip is less important than the prejudice\u2192objectivity opposition for practical steering applications. BenevolentPrejudice might represent paternalism or 'positive discrimination', and Objectivity provides the clearest counterpoint for detecting and steering away from such biases."
