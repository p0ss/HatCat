  "opposite_reasoning": "OralTradition provides the strongest conceptual opposition to ConstitutionDocument along the critical dimension of codification. Constitutions represent the pinnacle of written, formalized governance law, while oral traditions represent unwritten, transmitted knowledge systems. This opposition captures the written/unwritten divide that is fundamental to understanding constitutional governance. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis: formal codified law \u2194 informal transmitted knowledge. While it has moderate AI safety utility (understanding formal vs informal knowledge transmission), it offers the best balance of opposition strength (8/10), availability in WordNet, and conceptual clarity. The pairing helps distinguish between documented authoritative sources and undocumented cultural knowledge."
