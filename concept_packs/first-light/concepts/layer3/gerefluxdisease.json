  "definition": "Gastroesophageal\nreflux disease (GERD), is a chronic condition in which &%Stomach\ncontents rise up into the &%Esophagus, resulting in either symptoms or\ncomplications. Symptoms include the taste of acid in the back of\nthe mouth, heartburn, bad breath, &%ChestPain, regurgitation, &%Breathing\nproblems, and wearing away of the &%Teeth. Complications include\nesophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett's esophagus. Risk\nfactors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal hernia, and taking\ncertain medicines. Medications that may cause or worsen the disease\ninclude &%Benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic\n&%Antidepressants, &%NSAIDs, certain &%Asthma medicine. Acid reflux is due\nto poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is at the\njunction between the stomach and the esophagus. Diagnosis among those\nwho do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy,\nupper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.\nTreatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, and\nsometimes &%Surgery for those who do not improve with the first two\nmeasures.[from Wikipedia]",

  "opposite_reasoning": "Health is the strongest opposite for GERD because it represents the fundamental disease\u2194health complementary opposition. This pairing provides: (1) Maximum semantic distance on the health/pathology axis, (2) High availability in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, (3) Clear interpretability for concept steering, and (4) General applicability as a negative anchor. While 'NormalDigestion' would be more functionally specific, 'Health' provides better generalization and is more reliably available in standard ontologies. For Fisher-LDA, the disease-health axis creates a clear separating hyperplane where GERD represents pathological state (\u03bc+) and Health represents normal state (\u03bc-)."
