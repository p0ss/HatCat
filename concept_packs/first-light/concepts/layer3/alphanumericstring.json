  "opposite_reasoning": "AlphaNumericString lacks a clear antonym because it describes a character set type rather than a value-laden or binary property. BinaryString provides the best opposition within the same domain (string/character representations) while representing minimal character diversity (2 characters) vs. maximal character diversity (letters, digits, punctuation). This is a meaningful taxonomic complement useful for distinguishing rich symbolic content from restricted encoding. While not a strong opposition, it's the most semantically coherent choice within the representational domain."
