  "opposite_reasoning": "NobleGases provides the strongest semantic opposition to Halogens based on fundamental chemical properties: maximum reactivity vs maximum inertness. Both are element groups at the same taxonomic level (periodic table groups), making them perfectly comparable while being behaviorally opposite. This creates an ideal axis for Fisher-LDA where the concepts are maximally separated in chemical property space. While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (chemistry concepts have limited deception-detection relevance), the opposition strength is exceptional for the concept space, and Noble Gases likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO."
