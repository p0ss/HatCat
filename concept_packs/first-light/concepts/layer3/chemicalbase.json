  "opposite_reasoning": "ChemicalAcid (or simply Acid) is the definitive opposite of ChemicalBase. This is one of the clearest examples of binary chemical opposition in chemistry, analogous to hot/cold in temperature. The acid-base pair represents complementary chemical properties: opposite litmus reactions, opposite pH values, neutralization when combined, and opposite proton behavior (donor vs acceptor). For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum semantic separation on a well-defined chemical spectrum. The opposition is scientifically rigorous, measurable, and has clear operational definitions. While not directly related to AI safety concepts like deception/honesty, it provides strong geometric separation for the chemical domain, which is valuable for testing and validating the Fisher-LDA approach on objective, well-understood oppositions."
