  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalAttribute provides the strongest complementary opposition to ArtifactAttribute. This pairing captures the fundamental manufactured/natural dichotomy at the attribute level, which is taxonomically clean and semantically meaningful. The artifact vs. natural distinction is well-established in SUMO's upper ontology and creates a clear axis for Fisher-LDA: properties of human-made objects vs. properties of naturally occurring objects. This is useful for AI safety in distinguishing between engineered/designed characteristics and inherent/natural ones, which can be relevant for detecting manipulation or artificial patterns."
