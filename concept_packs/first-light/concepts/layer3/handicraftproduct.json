  "opposite_reasoning": "MassProducedProduct provides the strongest semantic opposition to HandicraftProduct along the most relevant dimension: production method. The contrast between artisanal/manual/skill-based creation vs automated/industrial/standardized manufacturing captures a fundamental dichotomy in product types. This opposition is more specific and meaningful than broader contrasts like 'natural vs manufactured' and maintains focus on the manufacturing process dimension that defines handicraft products. While this may need to be added to layers if missing, it represents a legitimate and important ontological distinction in product taxonomy."
