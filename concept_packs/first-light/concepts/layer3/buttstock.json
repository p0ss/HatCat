  "opposite_reasoning": "Buttstock is a highly specific physical component with no natural semantic antonym. Among the options, Muzzle provides the strongest opposition because: (1) Both are firearm parts, maintaining semantic coherence; (2) They represent opposite spatial endpoints (rear vs. front) of the same object; (3) They have opposite functions - Buttstock interfaces with the user's body for control/stability, while Muzzle interfaces with the external environment for projectile discharge; (4) Both concepts are likely well-represented in WordNet/SUMO. While this opposition has limited utility for AI safety/deception detection (steering_utility=2), it's the most semantically valid opposite for this specific technical term. The alternative category-level opposites (Software, EmotionalState) are too distant and would not create a meaningful Fisher-LDA axis for this specific weapon component."
