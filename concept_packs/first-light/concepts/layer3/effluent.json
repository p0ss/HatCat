  "opposite_reasoning": "PotableWater provides the strongest semantic opposition to Effluent along the most relevant dimension: usability and safety. Effluent is water rendered unusable through contamination with waste, while potable water is explicitly safe for human consumption. This opposition captures both the purity dimension and the functional/safety dimension. It's likely to exist in both WordNet (as 'drinking water' synsets) and SUMO ontologies, and provides clear separation for Fisher-LDA axes. The opposition is meaningful for understanding contamination vs. purification concepts, which could have analogical relevance for AI safety in terms of corrupted vs. clean data/processes."
