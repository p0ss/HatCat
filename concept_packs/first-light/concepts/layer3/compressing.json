  "opposite_reasoning": "Expanding is the optimal opposite for Fisher-LDA because: (1) It represents the clearest semantic opposite in terms of physical process directionality (inward pressure vs. outward growth), (2) It's abstract enough to capture the general concept while maintaining strong opposition (opposition_strength: 9), (3) It's highly likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies as a fundamental physical process, (4) While not directly AI-safety relevant, it provides clean geometric separation for concept space that could generalize to metaphorical uses (e.g., 'compressing information' vs 'expanding explanation'). Decompressing scores higher on opposition_strength (10) but is more specific and may have less coverage; Expanding is more fundamental and robust."
