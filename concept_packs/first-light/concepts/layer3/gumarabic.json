  "opposite_reasoning": "GumArabic is a highly specific substance concept (Layer 3) with no direct antonym. Among the candidates, Mineral provides the strongest semantic opposition: organic vs inorganic, biologically-derived vs geologically-formed, complex polysaccharide vs simple elemental/compound structure. This opposition captures fundamental material taxonomy differences. While 'ThinningAgent' offers better functional opposition, it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies. Mineral is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, making it practically available. Metal is also strong, but Mineral is more taxonomically precise as an opposite to plant-derived organic compounds."
