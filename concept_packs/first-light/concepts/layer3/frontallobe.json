  "opposite_reasoning": "FrontalLobe lacks a true antonym, but OccipitalLobe provides the strongest anatomical and functional opposition within the brain. The spatial opposition (front vs back of brain) and functional contrast (executive/planning functions vs visual processing) create meaningful semantic distance. This is a natural complementary pair within neuroanatomy - both are parts of cerebral cortex but maximally separated spatially and functionally. For Fisher-LDA, this provides clear distributional separation while maintaining ontological coherence (both brain regions). Note: This has limited AI safety utility as it's domain-specific anatomical knowledge, but provides valid geometric opposition for the concept space."
