  "opposite_reasoning": "FourPosterBed is a highly specific furniture type with no natural antonym. Among complementary concepts, Hammock provides the strongest semantic contrast: it represents the opposite design philosophy for sleeping furniture (suspended vs grounded, minimal vs elaborate, portable vs permanent). This opposition captures meaningful distinctions in the furniture domain while maintaining relevance to the same functional category (sleeping). For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis distinguishing traditional/structured/ornate furniture from minimalist/portable alternatives. However, this is admittedly a weak opposition for AI safety purposes - furniture types have limited relevance to deception detection or alignment monitoring."
