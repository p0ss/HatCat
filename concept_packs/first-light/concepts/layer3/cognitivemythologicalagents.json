  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalAgent provides the strongest and most interpretable opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. The key distinction is mythological/fictional vs. physical/real agents. This captures the fundamental nature of the concept (imagined entities from mythology) against concrete, physical agents in reality. While EmpiricalEntity has slightly stronger semantic opposition, PhysicalAgent is more likely to exist in the ontology layers, has clearer boundaries, and maintains the 'agent' semantic field which is important for consistent concept spaces. For AI safety applications, distinguishing fictional/mythological reasoning from physical-world reasoning could be relevant for grounding and reality-checking."
