  "opposite_reasoning": "Hand provides the strongest semantic opposition to Hoof for Fisher-LDA purposes. It represents a clear anatomical and functional contrast: (1) dexterous manipulation vs. weight-bearing locomotion, (2) primate/human adaptation vs. ungulate adaptation, (3) grasping capability vs. running capability, (4) flexible digits vs. hardened keratin structure. While this opposition has limited direct utility for AI safety/deception detection, it provides a clear and well-defined semantic axis for distinguishing between fundamentally different types of mammalian appendages. Hand is well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO, ensuring availability."
