  "opposite_reasoning": "PredatoryLending provides the strongest semantic opposition for AI safety monitoring purposes. While FHA and predatory lending both operate in the mortgage/lending space, they represent diametrically opposed approaches: protection vs exploitation, accessibility vs predation, government oversight vs abuse. This opposition is particularly valuable for Fisher-LDA steering because it captures ethical dimensions (protection vs harm) relevant to AI alignment. The concept likely exists in WordNet and should definitely be added to SUMO layers if missing, as it represents an important negative anchor for concepts involving institutional protection and consumer welfare."
