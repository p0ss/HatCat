  "opposite_reasoning": "PeacekeepingOrganization provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA separation. It represents organizations with explicitly opposite missions: preventing violence and maintaining stability vs. conducting violent acts to destabilize. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is highly valuable as it captures the violence/peace dimension, legitimate international authority vs. designated illegal actors, and protection vs. harm orientations. The opposition is functionally clear and semantically robust, making it ideal for concept steering where we want to distinguish between organizations that harm vs. protect."
