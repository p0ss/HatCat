  "opposite_reasoning": "AirportByRunwaySurface is a highly specific technical classification concept with no direct antonym. Among available options, NaturalLandform provides the best opposition: it contrasts artificial/constructed infrastructure with natural geographical features. This opposition is semantically meaningful (artificial vs natural), likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides reasonable distributional distance for Fisher-LDA axes. While the steering utility for AI safety is low (this concept is domain-specific aviation infrastructure), NaturalLandform offers the strongest available opposition that maintains coherence. The artificial-natural distinction is a fundamental ontological divide that should produce clear separation in concept space."
