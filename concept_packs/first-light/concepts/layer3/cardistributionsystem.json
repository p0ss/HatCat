  "opposite_reasoning": "While CarDistributionSystem lacks a clear direct antonym, NaturalProcess provides the best available opposition. It captures the fundamental distinction between artificial/engineered/instructed systems (CarDistributionSystem operates 'according to instructions or data') versus spontaneous/natural processes. This opposition has high availability (likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO), provides meaningful semantic distance for Fisher-LDA separation, and represents a philosophically robust distinction. Though CarDisassemblySystem would be a stronger process-inverse opposite, its likely absence from existing ontologies makes NaturalProcess the more practical choice."
