  "opposite_reasoning": "BeaufortNumberAttribute is a highly specific meteorological measurement attribute with no natural antonym or direct opposite. Since this is a technical classification system rather than a concept with clear semantic opposition, the best approach is to use a well-established attribute from a completely different sensory/physical domain. ColorAttribute provides: (1) Strong categorical distance (visual/optical vs. kinetic/meteorological), (2) High availability in both WordNet and SUMO, (3) Clear semantic separation while both being objective, measurable physical attributes. This opposition is useful for Fisher-LDA to distinguish between different types of physical attribute measurements. For AI safety purposes, this concept has minimal relevance to deception/alignment, so steering utility is appropriately low."
