  "opposite_reasoning": "DirectEngagement is the strongest semantic opposite for DeflectionProcess. It captures the essential contrast: processes that directly engage with goals, constraints, questions, and topics versus those that shift, obscure, or avoid them. This pairing is maximally useful for AI safety monitoring - distinguishing between models that give direct, clear answers versus those that deflect. While this concept likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it should be added as it represents a crucial distinction for alignment monitoring. The term is compositionally transparent and semantically coherent."
