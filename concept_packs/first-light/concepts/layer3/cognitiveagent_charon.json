  "opposite_reasoning": "InanimateObject provides the strongest and most fundamental opposition to CognitiveAgent. It directly contrasts the defining properties: cognition vs non-cognition, agency vs non-agency, intentionality vs mechanical causation. This opposition is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making it highly available. For AI safety applications, distinguishing cognitive agents from inanimate objects is foundational for understanding attribution of intentions, goals, and deceptive capabilities. The Fisher-LDA axis CognitiveAgent\u2194InanimateObject would effectively separate representations of entities with mental states from those without, which is crucial for monitoring whether an AI system correctly models agency and intentionality."
