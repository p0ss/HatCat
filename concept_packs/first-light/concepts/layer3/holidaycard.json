  "opposite_reasoning": "EmailMessage provides the strongest complementary opposition along the physical/digital dimension while maintaining semantic coherence within the communication domain. Both serve similar social functions (maintaining relationships, conveying messages) but through opposed media. This opposition is clean, well-defined, and likely to create a meaningful Fisher-LDA axis distinguishing physical traditional communication from digital modern communication. The concepts are likely to have distinct distributional patterns in text while being semantically related enough to create interpretable axes."
