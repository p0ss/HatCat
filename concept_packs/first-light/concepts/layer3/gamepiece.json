  "opposite_reasoning": "GamePiece lacks a direct antonym, but NaturalObject provides the strongest semantic opposition as it captures the fundamental Artifact vs. Natural distinction. GamePiece is definitionally an artifact - a human-made object designed for gaming purposes. NaturalObject represents the complementary space of things that exist independent of human manufacturing intent. This opposition is: (1) ontologically grounded in SUMO's top-level distinctions, (2) provides clear separation in semantic space for Fisher-LDA, (3) highly available in both WordNet and SUMO, (4) generalizable across all GamePiece children (balls, dice, etc. are all manufactured artifacts). While GameBoard is contextually closer as a gaming complement, NaturalObject provides stronger distributional separation and is more useful for general concept steering."
