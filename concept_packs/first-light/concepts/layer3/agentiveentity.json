  "opposite_reasoning": "InanimateObject provides the strongest semantic opposition to AgentiveEntity. The fundamental distinction between animate/inanimate maps directly onto agency/non-agency in SUMO's ontology. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is valuable: distinguishing agentive systems (which can deceive, manipulate, or misalign) from non-agentive objects (which cannot) is foundational. The concept is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, ensuring availability. This creates a clean Fisher-LDA axis where agentive entities cluster at one pole (humans, AI systems, organizations) and inanimate objects at the other (rocks, buildings, tools without autonomy)."
