  "opposite_reasoning": "CurriculumDesign is fundamentally about systematic, planned, structured educational programming. Its strongest semantic opposite is learning that occurs without such planning - spontaneous, emergent, and unstructured. This opposition captures the core dimension of planned vs. organic educational experiences. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents a legitimate and important educational concept (e.g., discovery learning, unschooling, emergent curricula) and would be valuable for Fisher-LDA steering to distinguish between planned systematic instruction and organic learning processes. For AI safety applications, this axis could help monitor whether systems are following structured reasoning vs. generating spontaneous/ungrounded outputs."
