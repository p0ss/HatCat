  "opposite_reasoning": "This provides the strongest semantic opposition while maintaining ontological consistency (both are Organization types). For Fisher-LDA, having \u03bc+ be organizations that manage communication infrastructure and \u03bc- be organizations that explicitly do not manage such infrastructure creates a meaningful axis. This is more useful for AI safety monitoring than cross-category opposites (entity vs. state) because it helps distinguish organizational purposes and functions. The concept should be added to layers as a complementary organizational type - defining what organizations ARE by contrasting with what they ARE NOT is valuable for ontological completeness."
