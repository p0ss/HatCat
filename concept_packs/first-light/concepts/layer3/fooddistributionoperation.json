  "opposite_reasoning": "While FoodDistributionOperation lacks a direct antonym in existing ontologies, FoodDestructionOperation provides the strongest practical opposite. Distribution builds capacity and sustains forces, while destruction eliminates resources and denies capability. This is a well-understood military concept (resource denial, scorched earth) with clear semantic opposition (provision vs. elimination). It scores high on opposition strength and confidence, and represents a legitimate military doctrine concept that should exist in SUMO's military operations taxonomy. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between supportive vs. destructive military operations is valuable for detecting potentially harmful operational planning."
