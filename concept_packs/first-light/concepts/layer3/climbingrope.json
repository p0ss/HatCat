  "opposite_reasoning": "ClimbingRope's defining characteristics are flexibility, dynamic stretch, and shock absorption - all material properties. BrittleMaterial represents the strongest opposition on these dimensions: inflexible, non-stretching, shattering under stress rather than absorbing it. While RigidStructure is similar, BrittleMaterial better captures the opposite of the safety-critical shock-absorption property. This provides meaningful semantic distance for Fisher-LDA while staying within a coherent material property space. The opposition is clear and interpretable for concept steering."
