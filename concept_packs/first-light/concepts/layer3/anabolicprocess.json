  "opposite_reasoning": "CatabolicProcess is the scientifically established antonym of AnabolicProcess in biochemistry and metabolism. They form a perfect complementary pair: anabolism builds up (synthesis, energy consumption) while catabolism breaks down (degradation, energy release). This opposition has maximum semantic distance along a clear dimensional axis (molecular complexity increase vs. decrease), making it ideal for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. The pair is well-established in both biological ontologies and WordNet, ensuring availability. For AI safety monitoring, while not directly related to deception/alignment, this clear biological opposition provides a strong example of process-level complementarity that can inform understanding of constructive vs. destructive processes more broadly."
