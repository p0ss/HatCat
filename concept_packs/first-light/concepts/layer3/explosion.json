  "opposite_reasoning": "Implosion provides the strongest semantic opposition to Explosion. Both are violent energy events but with opposite directionality: explosion involves outward burst and energy release, while implosion involves inward collapse and energy absorption/concentration. This creates a clear, intuitive conceptual axis. The opposition is well-established in physics, engineering, and common usage. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separation in concept space while maintaining semantic coherence. The pair would effectively capture the 'violent energy directionality' dimension."
