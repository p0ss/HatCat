  "opposite_reasoning": "Horn is a highly specific anatomical structure without a natural antonym. Among available options, SoftTissue provides the strongest material-property opposition (hard/bony vs soft/flexible) while remaining within the biological domain. This opposition captures the distinctive physical characteristics that define horn as a concept. The external/internal distinction with InternalOrgan was considered, but SoftTissue better captures the material essence of what makes horn distinctive. However, this is a weak opposition overall - Horn is too specific and concrete for strong semantic opposition."
