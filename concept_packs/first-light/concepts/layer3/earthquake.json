  "opposite_reasoning": "GeologicalStability provides the strongest conceptual opposition to Earthquake at the appropriate ontological level. While Earthquake represents sudden, violent seismic disruption, GeologicalStability captures the complementary state of tectonic equilibrium. This is a process/state-level opposition that is semantically coherent and maximizes the distinction for Fisher-LDA (high \u03bc+ - \u03bc- separation). The concept is likely present in SUMO's geological/physical process hierarchy. If unavailable, 'Stillness' serves as a more general but accessible alternative that captures the motion/stability dimension."
