  "opposite_reasoning": "While DiscourseIncoherenceProcess would be the ideal semantic opposite (direct negation of coherence), it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies. ConfabulationProcess offers the best balance: (1) It represents a process that lacks structured coherence and produces unreliable, disconnected narratives; (2) It has high AI safety relevance for detecting hallucination and incoherent outputs; (3) It likely exists in WordNet (confabulation is a recognized psychological term); (4) It provides strong opposition on the coherence/structure dimension. The term captures both the cognitive process aspect and the failure of discourse coherence that we need for effective Fisher-LDA separation."
