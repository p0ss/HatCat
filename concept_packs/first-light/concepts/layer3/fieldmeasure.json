  "opposite_reasoning": "StructuralAttribute provides the strongest principled opposition to FieldMeasure. The distinction between dynamic field properties (energy, electromagnetic fields, heat flow) and static structural properties (shape, size, topology) represents a fundamental ontological division in physics and measurement theory. This captures the field-vs-structure dichotomy that is scientifically meaningful and provides clear semantic separation for Fisher-LDA axes. While not a traditional antonym, it represents complementary measurement domains that rarely overlap, making it ideal for creating orthogonal concept spaces."
