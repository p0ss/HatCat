  "opposite_reasoning": "Opening is the clearest and strongest antonym for Closing. This is a natural binary opposition in the physical world (opening/closing doors, containers, eyes, etc.) and in abstract contexts (opening/closing opportunities, discussions, etc.). The synsets provided (01242832.v relates to closing doors/objects) strongly suggest physical closing actions, for which Opening is the perfect complement. This pairing will create a highly interpretable Fisher-LDA axis. Given the category child 'ClosingEyes', the opposite 'OpeningEyes' would be equally natural. Opening almost certainly exists in both WordNet and SUMO as a fundamental process concept."
