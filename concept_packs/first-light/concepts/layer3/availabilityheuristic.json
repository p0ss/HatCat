  "opposite_reasoning": "StatisticalReasoning provides the strongest conceptual opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. AvailabilityHeuristic involves making judgments based on how easily examples come to mind (memory availability), while StatisticalReasoning involves making judgments based on actual frequencies and probabilities. This creates a clear axis from biased-intuitive thinking to rational-statistical thinking. For AI safety, this axis is valuable for detecting when models rely on salient but unrepresentative examples versus proper probabilistic reasoning. The opposition is conceptually clean: mental availability vs. statistical validity."
