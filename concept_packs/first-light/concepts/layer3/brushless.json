  "opposite_reasoning": "This is a clear technical binary opposition with maximum opposition strength. While 'Brushless' describes motors without brushes, 'Brushed' describes motors with brushes - a true complementary pair in electrical engineering. The term exists in WordNet and should be added to SUMO layers for completeness. Though steering utility for AI safety is low (this is a technical engineering attribute unrelated to deception/alignment), it provides the strongest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA axis formation. The binary nature makes it ideal for centroid anchoring."
