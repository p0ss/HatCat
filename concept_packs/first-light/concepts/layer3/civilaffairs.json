  "opposite_reasoning": "CombatOperations provides the strongest semantic opposition to CivilAffairs within military doctrine. CivilAffairs represents non-kinetic, civilian-focused operations (governance, reconstruction, humanitarian assistance), while CombatOperations represents kinetic warfare and direct military engagement. This distinction is fundamental in military planning and creates a meaningful axis: civil engagement \u2194 combat operations. For Fisher-LDA, this provides good separation: CivilAffairs activities cluster around peacekeeping, infrastructure, and civilian liaison, while CombatOperations clusters around warfare, destruction, and enemy engagement. While not a pure binary antonym, it's the most conceptually coherent complementary opposite within the military domain."
