  "opposite_reasoning": "Theorem provides the strongest semantic opposition to Axiom within formal systems. The axiom-theorem distinction is fundamental to mathematics and logic: axioms are accepted without proof (primitive statements), while theorems require proof (derived statements). This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety as it relates to foundational vs. derived beliefs, and could help monitor whether an AI system is treating certain statements as unquestionable axioms vs. requiring justification. The concept is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available."
