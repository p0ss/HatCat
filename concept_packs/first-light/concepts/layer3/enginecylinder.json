  "opposite_reasoning": "EngineCylinder represents a concrete physical artifact/entity. Process provides strong categorical opposition (entity vs event/activity) with high availability in both WordNet and SUMO. While this opposition has moderate AI safety utility, it provides clear semantic distance for Fisher-LDA axes. The entity/process distinction is fundamental in ontology and will create reliable concept separation. AbstractEntity is also strong but Process offers better grounding in both ontologies and clearer conceptual boundaries."
