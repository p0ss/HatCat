  "opposite_reasoning": "While ArrowIcon lacks a direct antonym, Text provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. ArrowIcon represents iconic/pictorial symbolic communication (spatial, directional, non-linguistic), while Text represents linguistic/alphabetic symbolic communication (sequential, propositional, linguistic). This opposition captures a fundamental distinction in semiotic systems that is: (1) conceptually clear and defensible, (2) likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO with good coverage, (3) useful for distinguishing between visual-spatial vs linguistic concept spaces in AI safety monitoring. The high availability score ensures practical implementation, while the semantic distance is sufficient for effective centroid anchoring."
