  "opposite_reasoning": "ReflexiveProcess provides the strongest opposition for AI safety monitoring purposes. The deliberative/reasoned nature of epistemic processes (evaluating evidence, forming justified beliefs, revising knowledge) stands in clear opposition to automatic, non-reflective processes. This distinction is crucial for AI safety: we want to detect when an AI is engaging in careful epistemic reasoning (hypothesis generation, evidence evaluation, belief revision) versus operating on autopilot or learned reflexes. The deliberative\u2194automatic axis is highly relevant for understanding when systems are engaging in genuine reasoning versus pattern matching. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful axis separating conscious belief formation from unconscious reactions."
