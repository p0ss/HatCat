  "opposite_reasoning": "While EyeStillness would be the most semantically pure opposite (motion vs. non-motion), it likely doesn't exist in current ontologies. BodyMotion provides a pragmatic alternative that: (1) exists in both WordNet and SUMO, (2) offers meaningful taxonomic distinction within the motion domain (fine eye movements vs. gross body movements), (3) provides useful separation for Fisher-LDA by contrasting different types of physical motion. This is preferable to jumping to abstract concepts like MentalProcess, which may be too distant for effective steering on eye-related concepts."
