  "opposite_reasoning": "Eyebrow is a highly specific anatomical entity with no natural antonym or binary opposite. Among the candidates, InternalOrgan provides the strongest semantic opposition along a meaningful dimension (external/visible vs internal/hidden) while remaining within the anatomical domain. This is more principled than arbitrary distant body parts like Toe. For Fisher-LDA purposes, this external/internal axis creates a clearer separation in concept space than random anatomical distance. However, this opposition has minimal relevance to AI safety concerns."
