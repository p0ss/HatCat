  "opposite_reasoning": "BecomingSober is the perfect semantic opposite for BecomingDrunk as it represents the exact inverse process: transitioning from Drunk\u2192Sober versus Sober\u2192Drunk. This creates a clean binary opposition on a directional state-change spectrum. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separability as the two processes are mirror images. While it may not exist in current ontologies, it follows the same grammatical and conceptual pattern as BecomingDrunk, making it the most coherent choice. The opposition is clear, symmetric, and maximizes the semantic distance needed for effective concept steering."
