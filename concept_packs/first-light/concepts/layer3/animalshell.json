  "opposite_reasoning": "SoftBodyPart provides the strongest semantic opposition along the most salient dimension of AnimalShell: the hard/protective vs soft/vulnerable axis. This is a natural biological complementarity that creates clear separation in feature space. While AnimalShell lacks a direct antonym, this complementary concept captures the essence of what makes shells distinctive (hardness, protection) and opposes it with the contrasting biological reality (softness, vulnerability). The opposition is intuitive, semantically coherent, and likely to create useful Fisher-LDA axes. Though steering utility for AI safety is modest (this is primarily a biological/physical concept), the strong opposition strength makes it the best choice for creating well-separated concept centroids."
