  "opposite_reasoning": "Filling is the strongest complementary opposite to Digging. The two processes are direct inverses: digging removes material to create voids/holes going downward, while filling adds material to occupy voids going upward. This complementary relationship provides maximum semantic distance for Fisher-LDA while remaining coherent and ontologically sound. The opposition is clear, intuitive, and likely well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. For AI safety steering, this provides a clean axis for understanding material manipulation processes (removal vs. addition), though it has moderate rather than high safety relevance since these are physical construction activities rather than alignment-critical concepts."
