  "opposite_reasoning": "InfiniteSet is the mathematically precise and natural opposite of FiniteSet. This binary opposition (finite vs infinite cardinality) is fundamental in set theory and creates the strongest semantic axis. The opposition is clean, well-defined, and universally recognized. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separation: \u03bc+ (FiniteSet) and \u03bc- (InfiniteSet) will have minimal distributional overlap. While AI safety utility is moderate (these are abstract mathematical concepts), the strength and clarity of opposition makes this ideal for concept axis construction. InfiniteSet should exist in SUMO as the natural complement to FiniteSet."
