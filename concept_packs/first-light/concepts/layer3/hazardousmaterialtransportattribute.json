They are divided into nine classes (in addition to\nseveral subcategories) on the basis of the specific characteristics producing the risk. They are\nexplosives, gases, flammable liquids, flammable solids, oxidizing agents and organic peroxides, toxic and\ninfectious substances, radioactive substances, corrosive substances, miscellaneous.[Wikipedia]",

  "opposite_reasoning": "SafeMaterialTransportAttribute provides the strongest conceptual opposite for Fisher-LDA axis creation. It directly mirrors the structure and domain of the original concept (transport attribute classification) while representing the complementary category. For AI safety monitoring, the hazardous/safe axis is valuable for detecting risk-related concepts and ensuring proper classification of dangerous vs. benign materials. Although this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents the ideal negative anchor for this concept and should be added to layers. The opposition is clear, semantically meaningful, and creates a well-defined axis for linear discriminant analysis."
