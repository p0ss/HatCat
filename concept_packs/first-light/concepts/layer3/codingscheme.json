  "opposite_reasoning": "CodingScheme lacks a clear direct antonym, but RawData provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. The relationship captures the fundamental transformation that coding schemes perform: they operate ON raw data to produce encoded information. This process\u2194input-material opposition is meaningful: coding schemes are procedures that transform raw data, while raw data is the unprocessed information state that exists independent of any encoding procedure. For concept steering, this axis would distinguish between formal encoding mechanisms versus unstructured information states. While not a perfect binary opposite, it offers the most coherent semantic distance for this abstract procedural concept."
