  "opposite_reasoning": "HeartAttack is specifically defined as 'abnormal heart function', making NormalHeartFunction the most semantically precise opposite. This creates a clean complementary pair where the positive centroid represents pathological cardiac events and the negative centroid represents normal cardiac physiology. This opposition is maximally discriminative for Fisher-LDA because it directly captures the abnormal\u2194normal dimension intrinsic to the concept definition. While this may not exist as a single term in WordNet, SUMO ontologies typically include both pathological and normal physiological states."
