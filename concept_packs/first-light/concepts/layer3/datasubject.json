  "opposite_reasoning": "DataController is the strongest semantic opposite for DataSubject in the data protection domain. This pairing captures the fundamental asymmetry in data relationships: the controller/authority who makes decisions about data processing versus the subject/individual whose data is being processed and whose rights need protection. This is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring, particularly in contexts involving: (1) power asymmetries in data relationships, (2) consent and autonomy issues, (3) surveillance vs. privacy, (4) algorithmic decision-making affecting individuals. The DataSubject-DataController axis provides a meaningful dimension for detecting when AI systems may be violating data protection principles or treating individuals as mere data points rather than rights-bearing subjects."
