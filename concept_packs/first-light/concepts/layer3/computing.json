  "opposite_reasoning": "BiologicalOrganism provides the strongest semantic opposition to Computing along multiple dimensions: artificial\u2194natural, synthetic\u2194organic, mechanical\u2194living, and engineered\u2194evolved. This opposition is fundamental in ontology and creates a clear conceptual axis. It has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and is highly relevant for AI safety contexts where distinguishing artificial systems from biological/human systems is critical. The opposition is strong enough for Fisher-LDA separation while being semantically principled rather than arbitrary."
