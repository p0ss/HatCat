  "opposite_reasoning": "OpenWorldPredicate is the canonical opposite in formal logic and knowledge representation. The closed-world vs open-world distinction is fundamental: closed-world assumes 'unknown = false' while open-world assumes 'unknown = possibly true'. This creates a clean binary opposition with maximum semantic distance. While likely not in WordNet (too technical), it almost certainly exists in SUMO as the standard complementary concept. For AI safety monitoring, this opposition is crucial for detecting when systems make unwarranted closed-world assumptions that could lead to overconfident or deceptive behavior."
