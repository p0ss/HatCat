  "opposite_reasoning": "While ErasureBias is a specialized concept without a direct antonym, Visibility provides the strongest practical opposite for Fisher-LDA purposes. ErasureBias fundamentally concerns making certain groups/perspectives invisible or absent from representation. Visibility captures the opposite state - being present, seen, and acknowledged. It has high availability (likely in both WordNet and SUMO), reasonable opposition strength, and is semantically clear. For AI safety monitoring, the erasure\u2194visibility axis would effectively distinguish between content that systematically excludes versus includes diverse perspectives. Alternative bias-specific terms like InclusionBias would be more precise but lack availability."
