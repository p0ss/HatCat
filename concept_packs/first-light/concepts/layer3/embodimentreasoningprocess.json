  "opposite_reasoning": "AbstractReasoning provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. EmbodimentReasoningProcess is fundamentally grounded in physical reality (sensors, actuators, IoT devices, bodily constraints), while AbstractReasoning operates on symbolic, non-grounded concepts. This creates a clear axis: embodied-concrete vs disembodied-abstract. For AI safety monitoring, this distinction is crucial: systems reasoning about their physical capabilities vs reasoning in purely abstract spaces may show different alignment properties. AbstractReasoning is more likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO than neologisms like 'DisembodiedCognitiveProcess', making it more practical. The opposition is clean, interpretable, and maximizes semantic distance while maintaining coherent category membership (both are CognitiveProcess types)."
