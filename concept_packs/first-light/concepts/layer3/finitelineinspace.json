  "opposite_reasoning": "InfiniteLineInSpace provides the strongest semantic opposition as it represents the natural complementary partition within the LineInSpace taxonomy. The finite/infinite distinction creates a clear binary opposition based on the presence or absence of endpoints, which is the defining characteristic of FiniteLineInSpace. This pairing would create a meaningful axis for distinguishing bounded vs. unbounded linear geometric entities. While this has limited direct relevance to AI safety/deception detection, it's the most semantically coherent opposition for this geometric concept."
