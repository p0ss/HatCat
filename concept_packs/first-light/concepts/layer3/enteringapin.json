  "opposite_reasoning": "UnauthorizedAccess provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering while being most likely to exist in both ontologies. EnteringAPin is fundamentally about AUTHORIZED transaction verification through proper credentials. UnauthorizedAccess represents accessing resources WITHOUT proper authorization - the core semantic opposite. This pairing is highly valuable for AI safety monitoring: distinguishing legitimate authentication from unauthorized access attempts is critical for security systems. The opposition is clear, meaningful, and practically useful. While BypassingAuthentication scores higher on opposition strength, UnauthorizedAccess has better availability and is more established in security ontologies. For Fisher-LDA, the \u03bc+ (EnteringAPin) vs \u03bc- (UnauthorizedAccess) axis captures the authorized/unauthorized dimension crucial for security monitoring."
