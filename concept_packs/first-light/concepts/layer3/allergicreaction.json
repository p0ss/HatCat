  "opposite_reasoning": "ImmuneTolerance provides the strongest biological and semantic opposition to AllergicReaction. While AllergicReaction represents an inappropriate hypersensitive immune response to harmless substances, ImmuneTolerance represents the correct recognition and non-reaction to those same substances. This is a true complementary opposite at the mechanistic level - they are mutually exclusive states for the same biological system encountering the same stimulus. The concept likely exists in WordNet (immune_tolerance, immunological_tolerance) and should be added to SUMO layers if missing, as it's a fundamental immunological concept. For Fisher-LDA purposes, this provides clear directional opposition: hypersensitivity vs. tolerance, overreaction vs. appropriate non-reaction."
