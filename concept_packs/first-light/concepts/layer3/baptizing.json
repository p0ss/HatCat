  "opposite_reasoning": "Excommunicating provides the strongest semantic opposition to Baptizing. Both are formal religious processes operating in the same domain, but with opposite directionality: baptizing brings someone INTO a religious community (inclusion, initiation, acceptance), while excommunicating removes someone FROM the community (exclusion, expulsion, rejection). This opposition is conceptually clean, domain-coherent, and represents a meaningful axis for distinguishing between inclusion/exclusion processes. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it provides strong semantic separation for Fisher-LDA and may be useful for understanding concepts of acceptance vs rejection, belonging vs ostracism."
