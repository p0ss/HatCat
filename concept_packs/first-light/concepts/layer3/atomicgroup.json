  "opposite_reasoning": "While AtomicGroup lacks a clear direct antonym, AbstractEntity provides the strongest ontological opposition. AtomicGroup is a highly specific physical/chemical structure at the molecular level - a concrete, measurable, material entity. AbstractEntity represents the fundamental physical-abstract divide in ontology. This opposition is: (1) Strong semantically (8/10) - maximally distant in the concrete-abstract dimension; (2) Reliably available in SUMO (9/10); (3) Useful for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring because it creates clear distributional separation. For AI safety contexts, distinguishing physical from abstract concepts helps models understand materiality vs. conceptual reasoning. The alternatives (SingleAtom, UnboundAtom) are more specific chemical opposites but less likely to exist as formal ontological terms and provide weaker distributional contrast."
