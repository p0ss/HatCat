  "opposite_reasoning": "Observation provides the strongest semantic opposition with high utility for AI safety monitoring. The distinction between direct perception (Observation) and reasoned inference (Argument) is fundamental to epistemology and critical for understanding AI reasoning patterns. This opposition captures the difference between data collection and hypothesis formation - key for detecting when an AI is making unsupported inferences vs. reporting observations. The concept is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, and the opposition is clear enough for effective Fisher-LDA steering while being semantically meaningful rather than arbitrary."
