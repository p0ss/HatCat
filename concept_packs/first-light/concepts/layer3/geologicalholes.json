  "opposite_reasoning": "Mountain provides the best balance of opposition strength, availability, and semantic clarity. While GeologicalProtrusions would be the ideal conceptual opposite (depression vs elevation, concave vs convex), it likely doesn't exist as a formal SUMO category. Mountain exists in both WordNet and SUMO, provides strong physical opposition (elevated positive formation vs depressed negative formation), and maintains the geological domain. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis of geological depression \u2194 geological elevation. The opposition is intuitive and geometrically grounded."
