  "opposite_reasoning": "PublicDomain provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. CopyrightAuthority deals with establishing and protecting copyright, while PublicDomain represents the absence of copyright protection - a clear complementary relationship. This opposition captures the fundamental distinction between copyrighted (protected, registered, controlled) and non-copyrighted (free, unregistered, unrestricted) intellectual property. PublicDomain exists in both WordNet and SUMO, ensuring availability. While UnauthorizedCopier has stronger semantic opposition (authority vs. violator), it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies and would require creation. For AI safety monitoring, the copyright/public-domain axis could help distinguish between respecting intellectual property boundaries vs. treating content as freely available."
