  "opposite_reasoning": "CloudyWeather is the optimal choice as the semantic opposite of ClearWeather. It represents the most direct and comprehensive antonym, capturing the fundamental atmospheric distinction between clear and cloud-covered skies. The opposition is binary and well-established in both meteorological terminology and common usage. While the steering utility for AI safety is moderate (weather concepts are less directly relevant to deception/alignment monitoring), the opposition strength is maximal (10/10) and the concept is highly likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. This creates a clean, interpretable Fisher-LDA axis that would effectively separate these two weather states in semantic space."
