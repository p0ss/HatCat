  "opposite_reasoning": "Passive provides the strongest practical opposition to CaseRole while maintaining high availability in both WordNet and SUMO. CaseRole represents active participation in activities (agent, patient, instrument roles), while Passive represents lack of active involvement or agency. This creates a meaningful spectrum for Fisher-LDA: active participation \u2194 passive non-involvement. The opposition is particularly useful for AI safety monitoring where distinguishing between active agents versus passive observers/affected parties is important. While 'Uninvolved' might seem more direct, 'Passive' is better established in ontologies and captures the nuance of the participation spectrum more effectively."
