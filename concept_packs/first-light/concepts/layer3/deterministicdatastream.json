  "opposite_reasoning": "StochasticDataStream is the strongest opposite for DeterministicDataStream. This pairing represents a fundamental binary opposition in information theory and data streaming: deterministic (predictable, constant-time intervals) vs stochastic (probabilistic, variable-time intervals). This opposition is widely recognized in computer science and signal processing domains. The concept likely exists in SUMO's ontology as it's a standard technical term. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between predictable/regular behavioral patterns vs unpredictable/irregular ones, which may be relevant for anomaly detection in AI systems."
