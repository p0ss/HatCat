  "opposite_reasoning": "AnabolicProcess is the textbook antonym of CatabolicProcess in biochemistry and metabolism. These represent the two fundamental types of metabolic pathways: catabolism (breakdown, energy-releasing) and anabolism (synthesis, energy-consuming). This binary opposition is well-established in biological sciences, provides maximum semantic distance along a clear axis, and will create the strongest Fisher-LDA separation. The pair represents a complete metabolic dichotomy where organisms balance both processes for homeostasis. For AI safety applications, while not directly related to deception/alignment, this clear process opposition can help establish robust concept boundaries for biological and process-related reasoning."
