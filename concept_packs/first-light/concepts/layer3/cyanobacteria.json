  "opposite_reasoning": "Eukaryote represents the most fundamental and scientifically valid taxonomic opposition to Cyanobacteria. The prokaryote/eukaryote division is the primary cellular dichotomy in biology. While this opposition has limited direct AI safety implications, it provides the strongest semantic contrast for Fisher-LDA separation in biological concept space. This is a clear case where the concept is highly specific to biology and lacks relevance to deception/alignment monitoring."
