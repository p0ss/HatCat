  "opposite_reasoning": "Extension is the canonical anatomical antonym of Flexion in medical and kinesiological terminology. These two concepts form a fundamental binary opposition in describing joint movements: flexion decreases the angle between bones while extension increases it. This is a textbook example of a clear, well-established antonym pair. The opposition strength is maximal (10/10) because they are mutually exclusive actions on the same anatomical structures. While the steering utility for AI safety is modest (3/10) since this is a domain-specific physical process rather than a deception/alignment-related concept, the clarity and strength of the opposition makes it the ideal choice for Fisher-LDA axis construction. Extension almost certainly exists in both WordNet and SUMO given its fundamental nature in anatomy and physiology ontologies."
