  "opposite_reasoning": "BaseballBat is a specific physical artifact without a natural antonym. Among available options, AbstractEntity provides the strongest ontological opposition (Physical vs Abstract) which is fundamental in SUMO. This opposition is maximally useful for Fisher-LDA as it represents the clearest semantic distance. While this opposition has limited AI safety utility specifically, it provides mathematically clean separation for concept space structuring. NaturalObject (Artifact vs Natural) is a close second but AbstractEntity represents more fundamental ontological opposition."
