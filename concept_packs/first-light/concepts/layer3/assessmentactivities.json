  "opposite_reasoning": "For AI safety monitoring and Fisher-LDA concept axes, UnreflectiveAction provides the strongest opposition. AssessmentActivities fundamentally involves deliberate evaluation, reasoning, and inference - reflective cognitive processes. The semantic opposite is action without reflection, assessment, or reasoning. This distinction is highly relevant for AI safety: distinguishing between systems that engage in deliberate reasoning/assessment vs those that act reflexively or without evaluation. This opposition captures the core cognitive dimension while being maximally useful for alignment monitoring (e.g., detecting whether an AI is engaging in genuine assessment vs automatic pattern-matching). While this concept may not exist in current ontologies, it represents a theoretically sound and practically valuable addition."
