  "opposite_reasoning": "Marketplace provides the strongest semantic opposition to Abbey across multiple dimensions: sacred vs profane space, contemplative vs commercial activity, religious vs secular purpose, monastic isolation vs public gathering. This opposition is culturally and historically resonant (monastery vs market square as contrasting social institutions). It offers clear conceptual distance while remaining in the same general category (human-built structures with social functions), making it ideal for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. The opposition is more semantically coherent than NightClub (which may be too modern/specific) and more functionally opposed than Factory or Stadium."
