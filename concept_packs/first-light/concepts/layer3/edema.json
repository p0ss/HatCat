  "opposite_reasoning": "Dehydration is the strongest practical opposite for Edema. While 'NormalTissueHydration' would be conceptually ideal as the healthy baseline, Dehydration has several advantages: (1) Likely already exists in both WordNet and SUMO, ensuring availability; (2) Represents clear opposition on the tissue fluid spectrum (excess vs. deficit); (3) Both are well-defined pathological states making them comparable in semantic space; (4) Provides strong contrast for Fisher-LDA axis construction. Though both are disease states rather than disease-vs-health, this actually provides better dimensional separation since they occupy opposite extremes of the same underlying dimension (fluid balance)."
