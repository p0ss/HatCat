  "opposite_reasoning": "RealNumber provides the strongest mathematically-grounded opposition to ComplexNumber. While not a true antonym, it represents the proper subset that lacks the defining characteristic (imaginary component) of ComplexNumbers. This complement relationship is semantically meaningful, well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, and creates a useful axis for distinguishing mathematical complexity levels. For Fisher-LDA, this axis would separate concepts involving complex/extended mathematical structures from simpler real-valued concepts. Though steering utility for AI safety is moderate (mathematical concepts are less directly relevant to deception/alignment), the opposition strength and availability make this the most reliable choice."
