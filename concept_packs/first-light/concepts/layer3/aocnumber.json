  "opposite_reasoning": "Prohibition offers the strongest semantic opposition to AOCnumber with high availability. AOCnumber represents official authorization/permission to operate commercially, while Prohibition represents the state of being legally forbidden from an activity. This creates a clean authorization\u2194prohibition axis. It exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between authorized/permitted vs. prohibited activities is valuable for detecting misalignment around rule-following and regulatory compliance. While UnauthorizedActivity might seem more specific, Prohibition is more foundational and likely to have better representation in the embedding space."
