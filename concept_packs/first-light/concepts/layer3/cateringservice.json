  "opposite_reasoning": "SelfService provides the strongest conceptual opposition to CateringService. The key distinction is the service delivery model: CateringService involves others providing food and services TO you (full-service, attended), while SelfService involves obtaining food/services BY yourself (unattended, self-sufficient). This is a clean, complementary opposition that captures a fundamental dimension of service provision. The opposition is mutually exclusive yet operates in the same domain (food/service industry), making it ideal for Fisher-LDA steering. While not a classic antonym, it represents the most meaningful semantic opposite for this commercial service process concept."
