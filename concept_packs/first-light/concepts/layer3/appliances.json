  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalObject provides the strongest and most semantically coherent opposition to Appliances. The artifact\u2194natural distinction is fundamental in ontology and creates clear separation: Appliances are human-designed, manufactured devices with specific functions, while NaturalObjects exist without human intervention or design intent. This opposition is widely recognized in both WordNet and SUMO, making it reliable for Fisher-LDA anchoring. The contrast is more principled than BiologicalOrganism (which includes only living things, missing rocks, water, etc.) and more direct than IntangibleAsset."
