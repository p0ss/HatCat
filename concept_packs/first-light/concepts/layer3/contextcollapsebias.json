  "opposite_reasoning": "ContextSensitivity provides the strongest semantic opposition to ContextCollapseBias. It directly captures the opposite cognitive/behavioral pattern: maintaining and responding to contextual distinctions rather than collapsing them. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis from 'ignoring context' to 'being sensitive to context'. This is particularly valuable for AI safety monitoring as context-inappropriate behavior is a key failure mode. While this concept may not exist in standard ontologies, it should be added as it represents a fundamental dimension for alignment."
