  "opposite_reasoning": "ClearWeather provides the strongest semantic opposition within the meteorological domain. Fogging is a weather phenomenon characterized by suspended particles reducing visibility; ClearWeather represents the opposite state with no obscuring particles and maximum visibility. This opposition is: (1) domain-appropriate (both meteorological processes), (2) captures the key opposition on visibility and atmospheric clarity, (3) likely exists in SUMO ontology, (4) provides clean semantic distance for Fisher-LDA centroid separation. While HighVisibility has slightly stronger opposition on the defining attribute, ClearWeather is more likely to exist as a complete concept in the ontology and provides better coverage of the overall phenomenon."
