  "opposite_reasoning": "Reassuring is the strongest antonym for Frightening in the danger-perception domain. It directly opposes the core semantic function: frightening alerts to danger and creates fear, while reassuring alleviates fear and signals safety. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separability along the fear/safety axis. For AI safety monitoring, this opposition is valuable for detecting when systems are inappropriately alarming users versus appropriately calming them. The concept is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies."
