  "opposite_reasoning": "Nation provides the strongest taxonomic opposition to County within the administrative hierarchy. Both are governmental territorial divisions, but Nation represents the largest sovereign unit while County represents the smallest administrative district. This creates a clear spectrum from local to national governance that will be useful for Fisher-LDA to establish meaningful axes. The opposition is semantic (small/local vs large/sovereign), well-defined, and both concepts reliably exist in WordNet and SUMO. While this opposition has limited direct relevance to AI safety concerns like deception detection, it provides a clean conceptual axis for understanding administrative scale and scope."
