  "opposite_reasoning": "While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents the strongest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA purposes. EnvironmentalWaterIssue captures problems, degradation, scarcity, and contamination, while EnvironmentalWaterOptimization captures solutions, pristine conditions, abundance, and thriving ecosystems. This creates the clearest centroid separation (\u03bc+ - \u03bc-) for a meaningful concept axis. The parallel structure (both environmental water concepts) with opposite valence (issue vs optimization) makes it ideal for monitoring and steering applications. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help detect when systems are discussing environmental problems versus solutions, important for assessing comprehension and alignment on sustainability topics."
