  "opposite_reasoning": "While GlobalCrossFunctionalTeam doesn't have a direct antonym, SolitaryAgent provides the strongest available opposition for Fisher-LDA steering. It inverts the key aspects: (1) collective vs individual, (2) distributed vs single-location, (3) collaborative vs independent. Most importantly, it likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it immediately usable. The opposition is semantic rather than arbitrary - contrasting team collaboration with individual agency. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between collaborative vs independent decision-making patterns."
