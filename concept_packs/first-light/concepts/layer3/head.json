  "opposite_reasoning": "Foot provides the strongest semantic opposition to Head along multiple dimensions: (1) Spatial - superior/inferior body positioning, (2) Functional - cognitive/sensory center vs. locomotion/support, (3) Anatomical - cephalic vs. pedal regions, (4) Cultural/linguistic - 'head to foot' is an established idiom representing complete body coverage. This opposition is clear, well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides maximum Fisher-LDA separation for body part concepts. While this has limited direct AI safety relevance, it provides clean taxonomic separation for anatomical concept spaces."
