  "opposite_reasoning": "While BusinessActivities lacks a clear direct antonym, NonCommercialActivity provides the strongest semantic opposition along the most relevant axis: commercial vs non-commercial intent. This distinction is particularly valuable for AI safety applications involving consent (GDPR), economic transactions, and business listings. The commercial/non-commercial divide helps distinguish contexts where business interests may influence behavior vs contexts without such pressures. Though it may not exist in current ontologies, it represents a natural complementary category that should be added. PersonalActivities is a close second but is slightly less precise (personal activities could still be commercial)."
