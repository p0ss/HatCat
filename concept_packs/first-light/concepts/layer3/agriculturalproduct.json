  "opposite_reasoning": "ManufacturedProduct provides the strongest and most coherent opposition to AgriculturalProduct. Both are concrete product categories, but they represent fundamentally different production methods: organic/cultivated vs. industrial/fabricated. This opposition is taxonomically sound (mutually exclusive sibling categories under Product), has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and creates a semantically meaningful axis for distinguishing natural agricultural outputs from industrial manufactured goods. The opposition is clean, well-established in ontologies, and useful for concept steering without introducing category confusion."
