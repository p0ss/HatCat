  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalLocation provides the strongest semantic opposition to ConceptPoint by contrasting abstract representational space with concrete physical space. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety applications where distinguishing between representation (internal model states) and reality (external world states) is critical. For concept steering and alignment monitoring, this axis can help identify when models conflate abstract conceptual reasoning with concrete physical claims. The pairing maintains high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and captures a fundamental ontological distinction relevant to grounding and representation."
