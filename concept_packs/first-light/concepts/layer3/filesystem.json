  "opposite_reasoning": "FileSystem fundamentally represents organized, hierarchical structure imposed on data. The best semantic opposite captures the absence of this organization. UnstructuredInformation provides the strongest conceptual opposition along the structured/unstructured axis, which is meaningful for distinguishing systematic organization from chaos. While BiologicalOrganism offers greater distributional distance, UnstructuredInformation is more semantically coherent and useful for understanding the essence of what FileSystem represents. This opposition would help a Fisher-LDA axis distinguish between organized vs. disorganized information concepts."
