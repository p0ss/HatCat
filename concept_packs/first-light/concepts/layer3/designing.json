  "opposite_reasoning": "Destroying represents the strongest semantic opposite to Designing. The creation\u2194destruction axis is fundamental and ontologically robust: Designing brings order, structure, and functionality into existence through intentional planning, while Destroying eliminates these properties. This opposition is (1) maximally distant in semantic space for effective Fisher-LDA separation, (2) philosophically grounded in fundamental ontological categories, (3) widely represented in both WordNet and SUMO, and (4) creates a clear axis useful for understanding intentional processes. The opposition is particularly strong because both are intentional processes (not mere states), making them comparable yet maximally opposed in outcome and purpose."
