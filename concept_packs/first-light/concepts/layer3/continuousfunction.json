  "opposite_reasoning": "DiscontinuousFunction is the clear mathematical antonym of ContinuousFunction, representing the binary opposition in mathematical analysis. A function is either continuous at a point or it is not (discontinuous). This provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA axes. While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (mathematical concepts are less directly relevant to deception/alignment than behavioral or intentional concepts), this is appropriate for this technical mathematical concept. The opposition is clean, well-defined, and should exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies."
