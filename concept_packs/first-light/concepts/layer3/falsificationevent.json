  "opposite_reasoning": "VerificationEvent is the strongest opposite for FalsificationEvent. It represents the complementary epistemic process where predictions are confirmed rather than refuted. This pairing is: (1) Philosophically grounded in scientific methodology (Popper's falsification vs verification), (2) Maximally useful for AI safety steering - distinguishing between claims being proven false vs proven true is critical for alignment monitoring and truthfulness detection, (3) Forms a clean binary opposition on the true/false axis of evidential outcomes, (4) Likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO as fundamental epistemological concepts. The FalsificationEvent\u2194VerificationEvent axis would be highly valuable for monitoring AI reasoning about truth-values, evidence evaluation, and claim assessment."
