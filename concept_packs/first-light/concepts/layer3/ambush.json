  "opposite_reasoning": "Warning is the strongest practical opposite for Ambush. It captures the key opposing dimension: surprise attack vs. advance notification. Warning has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, strong opposition strength (8/10), and maximum steering utility (9/10) for AI safety applications involving deception detection. While OpenConfrontation might be slightly stronger semantically, Warning exists in standard ontologies and directly opposes the 'surprise' element that makes ambush deceptive. For Fisher-LDA, the Warning-Ambush axis will effectively separate concealed hostile intent from transparent communication of danger."
