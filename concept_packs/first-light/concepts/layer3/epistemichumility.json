  "opposite_reasoning": "EpistemicArrogance is the ideal conceptual opposite because it directly negates each component of EpistemicHumility: (1) fails to track knowledge limits, (2) ignores/minimizes uncertainty, (3) resists belief revision despite new evidence. The parallel structure (Epistemic + opposing trait) makes it the cleanest anchor for Fisher-LDA. While it may not exist in current ontologies, its creation would be highly valuable for AI safety monitoring, particularly for detecting overconfident AI systems that don't properly calibrate uncertainty. The semantic symmetry provides maximum separation in concept space."
