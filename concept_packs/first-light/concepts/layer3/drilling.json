  "opposite_reasoning": "Filling is the strongest semantic opposite to Drilling because: (1) It represents the direct inverse operation - drilling removes material to create holes, filling adds material to close holes; (2) Both operate on the same semantic domain (material manipulation and hole management); (3) They form a natural complementary pair that would create a well-defined axis in concept space; (4) The opposition is clear, intuitive, and would provide strong separation for Fisher-LDA. While this pairing has moderate utility for AI safety applications (not directly related to deception/alignment), it represents a high-quality semantic opposition for the general ontology structure."
