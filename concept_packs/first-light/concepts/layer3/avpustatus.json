  "opposite_reasoning": "AVPUStatus is fundamentally a scale measuring deviation from normal consciousness in emergency contexts. The most semantically meaningful opposite is the normal, baseline physiological state that requires no emergency assessment. This captures the core opposition: abnormal/impaired consciousness requiring emergency evaluation vs. normal/healthy consciousness requiring no intervention. NormalPhysiologicalState scores highest on opposition strength and confidence, and likely exists in SUMO's medical ontology. While it may not exist as a specific term, the concept of normal/baseline physiological states is fundamental to medical ontology."
