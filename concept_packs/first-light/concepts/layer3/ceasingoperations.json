  "opposite_reasoning": "While 'CommencingOperations' would be the most semantically parallel construction, 'Beginning' is selected as the best practical choice for several reasons: (1) It has guaranteed high availability in both WordNet (synset 00235435.n) and SUMO ontologies, (2) It provides strong semantic opposition (9/10) as the natural antonym to cessation/termination, (3) It is a well-established concept that will have robust embeddings across language models, (4) It maintains clear temporal opposition useful for Fisher-LDA axis construction (beginning \u2192 ending spectrum), and (5) It's general enough to be useful across multiple contexts while specific enough to provide meaningful steering. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between start-up behaviors vs shutdown/termination behaviors in systems."
