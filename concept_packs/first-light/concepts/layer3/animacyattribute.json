  "opposite_reasoning": "Alive is the strongest and most natural antonym for AnimacyAttribute as defined ('appearing dead; not breathing or having no perceptible pulse'). It provides maximum semantic distance on the life/death binary dimension, which is ideal for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. The concept is universally available in both WordNet and SUMO, making it highly reliable. While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (7/10) since this isn't directly related to deception/alignment, it's still valuable for distinguishing life-state attributes which could be relevant in various safety contexts (e.g., distinguishing animate vs inanimate agents, detecting anthropomorphization)."
