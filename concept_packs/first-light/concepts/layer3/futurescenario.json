  "opposite_reasoning": "PastScenario provides the cleanest complementary opposition to FutureScenario, creating a clear temporal axis (past vs. future). This is semantically strong and useful for AI safety monitoring to distinguish between backward-looking reasoning (learning from history) and forward-looking reasoning (planning/prediction). The opposition is particularly relevant for detecting whether an AI is reasoning about historical patterns versus making projections. While it may not exist in current ontologies, its symmetry with FutureScenario makes it a natural addition that would enhance the ontological structure."
