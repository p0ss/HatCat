  "opposite_reasoning": "Durability provides the strongest practical opposition to BreakabilityAttribute with high confidence of existence in both WordNet and SUMO. While ResilienceAttribute would be the most semantically precise opposite (high resilience = low breakability), it likely doesn't exist as a distinct SUMO term. Durability captures the essence of 'resistance to breaking/damage' and forms a clear spectrum opposition: high breakability = low durability. This is more reliable than flexibility (which is orthogonal - things can be flexible AND breakable) and more concrete than abstract attribute categories."
