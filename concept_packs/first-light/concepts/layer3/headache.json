  "opposite_reasoning": "Relief is the strongest semantic opposite for Headache because: (1) It directly represents the absence or cessation of pain, which is the core feature of headache; (2) 'Relief from headache' is linguistically natural and captures the experiential opposite; (3) It maintains the same level of specificity - both are states rather than broad categories; (4) It has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies; (5) For Fisher-LDA, Relief provides a clear positive anchor against Headache's negative pain state, creating an interpretable axis for bodily discomfort. While Comfort and Wellness are also valid, Relief is more directly opposite to the acute pain experience."
