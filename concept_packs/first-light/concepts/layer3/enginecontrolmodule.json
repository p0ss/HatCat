  "opposite_reasoning": "EngineControlModule is a highly specific manufactured electronic control device. While it lacks a direct antonym, BiologicalOrgan provides the strongest semantic opposition: artificial/manufactured vs. natural/biological, electronic vs. organic, engineered control system vs. evolved regulatory system. This opposition is semantically meaningful (creates an artificial\u2194natural control system axis), has high availability (both concepts likely exist in WordNet and SUMO), and provides reasonable confidence. ManualControl would be conceptually stronger for the automation dimension but likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies and would need to be added. BiologicalOrgan offers the best balance of opposition strength, availability, and semantic clarity."
