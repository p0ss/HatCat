  "opposite_reasoning": "ATMSlot is a very specific physical artifact component - a narrow opening/receptacle. It lacks a traditional antonym, but the strongest semantic opposition comes from geometric/spatial complementarity. Protrusion captures the fundamental concave\u2194convex, receptacle\u2194projection opposition. This is more semantically meaningful than random distant concepts. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis distinguishing inward cavities/openings from outward extensions/projections. While not directly relevant to AI safety concerns like deception, it provides a valid geometric opposition axis that could help distinguish spatial relationship concepts."
