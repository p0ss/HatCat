  "opposite_reasoning": "Patient is the strongest semantic opposite for Agent based on fundamental semantic role theory. In linguistics and formal semantics, Agent-Patient is a canonical opposition representing the doer vs. receiver of actions. This provides maximum separation for Fisher-LDA while maintaining semantic coherence. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between entities that act (agents with agency/responsibility) vs. entities that are acted upon (patients without agency) is highly relevant for attribution, causality, and responsibility tracking. Patient likely exists in SUMO as it's a fundamental ontological concept, and if not, should definitely be added given its importance."
