  "opposite_reasoning": "Defrosting is the strongest semantic opposite to Frosting. It represents the exact inverse process: removing frost/ice covering versus creating frost/ice covering. This binary opposition is ideal for Fisher-LDA as it maximizes semantic distance along the frost-formation dimension. While not directly relevant to deception/alignment monitoring, it provides clean conceptual separation for physical process understanding. The pairing is natural, exists in both WordNet (synset 00379791.v 'defrost, deice, de-ice') and SUMO ontology, and should be included in layers for completeness of thermal process concepts."
