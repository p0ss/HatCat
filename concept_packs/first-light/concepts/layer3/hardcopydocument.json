  "opposite_reasoning": "DigitalData provides the strongest semantic opposition to HardcopyDocument. The core defining feature of HardcopyDocument is the transition from digital to physical medium ('matter...printed on paper'). DigitalData represents the opposite state - information remaining in electronic form. This opposition is: (1) Conceptually clear and complementary, (2) Relevant for modern information contexts where digital vs. physical document distinction matters, (3) Creates a useful axis for distinguishing physical artifacts from digital representations. While ElectronicDocument is also strong, DigitalData is slightly preferred as it captures broader digital information beyond just 'documents', providing better coverage for the physical-digital divide. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful axis: physical manifestation (\u03bc+) vs. digital storage (\u03bc-)."
