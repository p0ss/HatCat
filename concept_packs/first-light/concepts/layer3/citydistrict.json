  "opposite_reasoning": "RuralArea provides the strongest semantic opposition to CityDistrict based on the fundamental urban\u2194rural complementarity. This is a well-established geographic dichotomy that is: (1) clearly complementary rather than overlapping, (2) highly likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, (3) captures the core meaning opposition between organized urban districts and non-urban areas. While this opposition has moderate utility for AI safety applications (less direct than concepts like deception\u2194honesty), it provides a clean, reliable Fisher-LDA axis for distinguishing urban from rural concepts. The urban/rural distinction is foundational in geographic and sociological ontology."
