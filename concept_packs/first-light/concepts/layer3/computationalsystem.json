  "opposite_reasoning": "BiologicalSystem provides the strongest semantic opposition to ComputationalSystem. Both are complex systems capable of information processing, but they represent fundamentally different paradigms: evolved/organic vs. designed/artificial, wet vs. dry computation, emergent vs. engineered. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety steering because it captures the distinction between natural intelligence and artificial intelligence, biological cognition vs. computational cognition - highly relevant for alignment research. The contrast helps define what makes computational systems distinct from biological ones, which is crucial for understanding AI behavior in relation to human/animal behavior."
