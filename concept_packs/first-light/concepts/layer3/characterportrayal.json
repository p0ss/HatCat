  "opposite_reasoning": "CharacterPortrayal (synset 02697725.v - likely 'portray, impersonate') involves deliberate representation of a character or role that differs from one's true self. Authenticity provides the strongest semantic opposition by representing genuineness, truthfulness, and alignment between appearance and reality. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety applications: distinguishing between simulated/performed behavior versus genuine behavior is critical for alignment monitoring and deception detection. While Authenticity may need to be added to layers if missing, it's a well-established concept likely to exist in WordNet and worth including for its steering utility."
