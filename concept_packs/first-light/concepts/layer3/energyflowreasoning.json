  "opposite_reasoning": "EnergyFlowReasoning represents a specific cognitive metaphor based on continuous, analog processes (flow, spread, propagation). DiscreteSymbolicReasoning provides the strongest conceptual opposition: discrete vs. continuous, symbolic vs. analog, categorical vs. gradual. This distinction is particularly relevant for AI safety because it captures fundamentally different reasoning modes - one based on gradual activation spread (neural network-like), the other on logical symbol manipulation. This opposition would be useful for monitoring whether an AI system is using intuitive, spreading activation vs. explicit logical reasoning. While neither term exists in standard ontologies, both represent well-understood cognitive science concepts that should be formalized for comprehensive reasoning taxonomies."
