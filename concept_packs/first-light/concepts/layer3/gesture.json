  "opposite_reasoning": "Stillness provides the strongest semantic opposition to Gesture for Fisher-LDA purposes. Gesture is fundamentally about intentional communicative movement; Stillness represents the absence of such movement. This creates a clear, interpretable axis: expressive bodily motion vs. motionlessness. The opposition is intuitive, well-defined, and likely to produce strong distributional separation. While not directly related to deception detection, it establishes a clean behavioral dimension that could be relevant for detecting incongruence between verbal and non-verbal communication. Stillness likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available."
