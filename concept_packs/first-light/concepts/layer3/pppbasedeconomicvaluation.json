  "definition": "&%PPPBasedEconomicValuation\nis a class of relations used to state international economic information\nin U.S. dollar amounts.  The U.S. dollar amounts are derived from Purchasing\nPower Parity conversions of economic totals (e.g., GDP)  given in local\ncurrency.  This contrasts with a method of conversion based on currency\nexchange rates.  The PPP method is used by the CIA World Fact Book for\nthe purpose of presenting economic data for all countries covered.  Their\nbasis for PPP dollar price weights is the UN International Comparison Program\n(UNICP) and the work of Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.",
