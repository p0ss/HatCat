  "opposite_reasoning": "Dependent is the strongest choice as it is the primary lexical antonym in WordNet, has maximum opposition strength, and is highly available in both WordNet and SUMO. It captures the core semantic opposition: autonomous systems are self-governing and independent, while dependent systems require external support, control, or guidance. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is crucial for distinguishing between systems that operate independently vs those requiring external oversight. The dependent\u2194autonomous spectrum is fundamental to understanding agency, control, and alignment in AI systems."
