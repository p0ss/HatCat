  "opposite_reasoning": "EggWhite is the strongest complementary opposite to EggYolk. They represent mutually exclusive, anatomically distinct components of the same biological system (egg). This complementary opposition provides clear semantic distance for Fisher-LDA while maintaining biological coherence. The pairing is well-defined, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and represents a natural categorical split. While AI safety steering utility is modest (this is a domain-specific biological concept), the opposition strength and availability are excellent. This is preferable to forcing an artificial opposition with unrelated concepts."
