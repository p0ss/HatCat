  "opposite_reasoning": "FlavourAttribute lacks a true antonym because taste qualities don't have natural opposites (sweet isn't the opposite of salty in the way hot opposes cold). The best approach is complementary sensory modality opposition. TextureAttribute is selected over VisualAttribute because: (1) both are commonly applied to food contexts, creating parallel conceptual domains; (2) texture provides stronger opposition as it's completely independent from taste, whereas visual attributes of food often correlate with flavor expectations; (3) the tactile vs gustatory distinction is clean and orthogonal. This creates a useful Fisher-LDA axis distinguishing taste-based from touch-based perceptual attributes."
