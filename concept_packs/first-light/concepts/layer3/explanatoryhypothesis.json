  "opposite_reasoning": "EstablishedFact provides the strongest complementary opposition along the epistemological dimension of verification/acceptance. ExplanatoryHypothesis represents propositions in the conjectural/testing phase, while EstablishedFact represents propositions that have passed scrutiny and achieved acceptance. This axis is highly valuable for AI safety monitoring - distinguishing between when a system is appropriately uncertain/exploratory (hypothesis mode) vs. inappropriately confident (treating hypotheses as facts) or vice versa. The opposition is clean, conceptually coherent, and directly relevant to epistemic reasoning quality. If EstablishedFact isn't available in current layers, DirectObservation provides an excellent fallback focusing on the inference vs. empirical perception distinction."
