  "opposite_reasoning": "For AI safety monitoring with Fisher-LDA, the alignment\u2194misalignment axis is the most semantically coherent and practically useful opposition. While 'MisalignmentProcess' likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it represents the exact conceptual opposite needed for steering: processes that create divergence from norms/values vs. processes that create conformity. This is superior to partial opposites like 'ViolatingNorm' (too specific to rule-breaking) or weak contrasts like 'IntentionalProcess'. The term follows natural linguistic formation (align\u2194misalign) and is standard in AI safety discourse."
