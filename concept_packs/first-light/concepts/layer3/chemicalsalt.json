  "opposite_reasoning": "ChemicalSalt is a specific chemical entity concept without a natural antonym. Among the candidates, BiologicalSubstance provides the strongest conceptual opposition by contrasting inorganic chemical compounds with biological/organic substances. This opposition captures a fundamental distinction between synthetic/inorganic chemistry and biological chemistry, which is more semantically meaningful than state-of-matter contrasts (solid vs gas) or mixing categories. While OrganicCompound is also viable, BiologicalSubstance better captures the living/non-living dimension that adds semantic richness. However, this opposition has limited utility for AI safety applications focused on deception/alignment monitoring."
