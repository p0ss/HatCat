  "opposite_reasoning": "BodyMotion provides the strongest natural opposition to BodyPosition. While BodyPosition lacks a direct antonym, the static/dynamic (position/motion) distinction is fundamental in physics and embodied cognition. This complementary pair captures the difference between held states and active processes of the body. The opposition is semantically meaningful and both concepts should exist in standard ontologies. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis distinguishing static postural states from dynamic movement processes, which is useful for distinguishing different types of embodied representations in AI systems."
