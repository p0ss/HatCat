  "opposite_reasoning": "InternalReflection provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. The internal/external dimension is fundamental and highly relevant for AI safety monitoring: distinguishing between internal reasoning processes and external explanations is crucial for detecting alignment issues, deception, and post-hoc rationalization. While this concept may not exist in current ontologies, it represents a theoretically sound and practically useful opposite. The high steering utility (10/10) makes it worth adding to layers even if currently missing. This captures the critical distinction between 'what the system actually processes internally' vs 'what it chooses to communicate externally' - a key axis for safety monitoring."
