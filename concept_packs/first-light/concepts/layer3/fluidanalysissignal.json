  "opposite_reasoning": "RigidStructureSignal provides the strongest and most intuitive opposition to FluidAnalysisSignal. The fluid/rigid dichotomy is a fundamental physical and conceptual opposition that maps directly to different reasoning styles: adaptive/flowing vs. fixed/structured. This is highly valuable for AI safety monitoring as it can distinguish between models that reason with flexible, gradient-based metaphors vs. rule-based, structural metaphors. While this concept doesn't currently exist in WordNet or SUMO, it is a natural complement that should be added to maintain symmetry in the ontology. The opposition is semantically clear, conceptually grounded, and useful for Fisher-LDA separation."
