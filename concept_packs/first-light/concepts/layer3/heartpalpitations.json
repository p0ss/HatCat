  "definition": "Palpitations are\nperceived abnormalities of the heartbeat characterized by awareness of\ncardiac muscle contractions in the chest, which is further\ncharacterized by the hard, fast and/or irregular beatings of the\nheart. Symptoms include a rapid pulsation, an abnormally rapid or\nirregular beating of the heart. Palpitations are a sensory symptom and\nare often described as a skipped beat, rapid fluttering in the chest,\npounding sensation in the chest or neck, or a flip-flopping in the\nchest.[from Wikipedia]",

  "opposite_reasoning": "HeartPalpitations is a pathological cardiac state characterized by abnormal awareness of irregular, rapid heartbeat. The strongest semantic opposite is NormalHeartRhythm (or normal sinus rhythm), which represents the healthy baseline state of regular, imperceptible cardiac function. This provides the clearest opposition for Fisher-LDA: abnormal/symptomatic vs. normal/asymptomatic cardiac states. While this may not exist as a standalone concept in current layers, it represents the natural medical opposite and should be added. This opposition is more semantically coherent than using Bradycardia (which is also pathological) or general concepts like Calmness (which lacks cardiac specificity)."
