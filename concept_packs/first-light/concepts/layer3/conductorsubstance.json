  "opposite_reasoning": "Insulator is the clear choice as it represents the standard scientific antonym for conductor. It has maximum opposition strength (substances that actively resist electrical/thermal conduction vs. those that readily conduct), exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and provides a clean binary opposition ideal for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (this is a physical property rather than behavioral/moral concept), the opposition is semantically perfect for the concept domain. This pairing would enable clear differentiation in any reasoning involving material properties, energy transfer, or electrical systems."
