  "opposite_reasoning": "LandRegion_Solid provides the strongest complementary opposition for AtmosphericRegion_Air. They represent mutually exclusive geographical regions with clear physical differentiation (gaseous vs solid, above-surface vs at-surface). This opposition is: (1) semantically robust with high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, (2) captures multiple dimensions of opposition (material state, spatial position, physical density), (3) represents natural category boundaries in geographical ontology. While Vacuum_Space has higher opposition strength, LandRegion is more grounded in the same ontological level (both are GeographicRegion subclasses) making it more appropriate for Fisher-LDA anchoring. For AI safety applications, this pairing helps distinguish concepts related to aerial/atmospheric phenomena from terrestrial/ground-based concepts."
