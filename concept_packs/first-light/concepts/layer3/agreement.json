  "opposite_reasoning": "Disagreement is the strongest and most natural antonym for Agreement. It provides clear binary opposition: Agreement represents mutual consent and aligned understanding, while Disagreement represents lack of consensus and conflicting positions. This opposition is well-established in natural language, exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides excellent steering utility for AI safety applications. For alignment monitoring, the Agreement\u2194Disagreement axis can help detect when an AI system is representing consensus vs. conflict, or honoring commitments vs. breaking them. The opposition is semantically clean, maximizing Fisher-LDA separation."
