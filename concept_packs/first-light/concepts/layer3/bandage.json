  "opposite_reasoning": "Wound is the strongest semantic opposite because it represents the complementary problem that Bandage solves. This creates a clear, semantically meaningful axis: wound (injury/damage to tissue) vs. bandage (treatment/protection of tissue). This opposition is functionally grounded - bandages exist to treat wounds, making them natural complements. The pairing has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides strong opposition strength (8/10) for Fisher-LDA purposes. While not a classical antonym, the problem-solution complementarity provides excellent semantic distance for concept steering."
