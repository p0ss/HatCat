  "opposite_reasoning": "SovereignState provides the strongest semantic opposition along the axis of political autonomy and self-governance. DependencyOrSpecialSovereigntyArea is defined by external control from a distant power, while SovereignState is defined by complete independence and self-determination. This creates a clean Fisher-LDA axis: (politically controlled by others) \u2194 (fully self-governing). The concept is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, and the opposition is taxonomically sound within geopolitical entity hierarchies. For AI safety applications, this axis could help detect concepts related to autonomy, control, and power relationships."
