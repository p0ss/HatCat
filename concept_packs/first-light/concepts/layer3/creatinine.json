  "opposite_reasoning": "Nutrient provides the strongest semantic opposition to Creatinine for Fisher-LDA purposes. The opposition is based on clear functional complementarity in biological systems: nutrients are beneficial substances absorbed and utilized by the body (input), while creatinine is a waste product eliminated by the body (output). This waste-vs-resource opposition creates a meaningful semantic axis. While this opposition has minimal direct relevance to AI safety concerns like deception detection, it represents the most coherent and semantically robust opposition available for this specific biochemical term. The concept exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available."
