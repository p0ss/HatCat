  "opposite_reasoning": "Root provides the strongest within-domain opposition for Flower. They are complementary plant organs with opposite spatial positions (above/below ground), opposite functions (reproduction/absorption vs anchoring/nutrient uptake), and opposite developmental priorities. This complementary opposition within the same taxonomic domain (plant anatomy) will create the most useful Fisher-LDA axis for distinguishing flower-related concepts. While 'Stone' offers higher opposition strength through organic/inorganic contrast, 'Root' maintains biological coherence and provides more semantically meaningful steering within the plant/organism domain. For AI safety applications, this may be less directly relevant than conceptual opposites like deception/honesty, but provides clean taxonomic separation."
