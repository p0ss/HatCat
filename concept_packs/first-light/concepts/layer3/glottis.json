  "opposite_reasoning": "Glottis is a highly specific anatomical structure (an opening/void space) with no direct antonym. Among complementary anatomical opposites, Bone provides the strongest structural opposition: void-space vs solid-mass, soft-tissue-defined-opening vs hard-structural-support. Bone has excellent availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and while steering utility for AI safety is low (anatomical terms rarely relate to deception/alignment), Bone provides the most semantically coherent and maximally distant anchor point within the anatomical domain for Fisher-LDA axis construction. The void-vs-solid opposition is conceptually clear and should produce meaningful separation in embedding space."
