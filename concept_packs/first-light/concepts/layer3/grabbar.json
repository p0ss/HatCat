  "opposite_reasoning": "GrabBar is a specific safety device, and the most semantically meaningful opposition is with concepts representing danger or risk that safety devices mitigate. While GrabBar doesn't have a direct antonym, Hazard provides the strongest functional opposition: grab bars exist to prevent hazardous situations (falls, slips). This creates a clear semantic axis from safety-enhancement to danger-creation that would be useful for Fisher-LDA concept steering. The opposition is stronger than artifact/natural or functional/decorative distinctions."
