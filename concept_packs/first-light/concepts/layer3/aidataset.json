  "opposite_reasoning": "RawData provides the most semantically coherent opposition to AIDataset along the dimension of curation and structure. While AIDataset doesn't have a classic antonym, the curated/structured nature of datasets vs. raw/unprocessed data creates a meaningful spectrum for Fisher-LDA. This opposition is: (1) semantically clear and defensible, (2) likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO, (3) useful for distinguishing between processed/purposeful data collections vs. unfiltered information, which has relevance for AI safety monitoring (e.g., distinguishing training artifacts from natural language). The structured\u2194unstructured dimension is fundamental to understanding AI data pipelines."
