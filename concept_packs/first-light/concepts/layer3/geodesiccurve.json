  "opposite_reasoning": "RandomWalk is the most pragmatic choice among the candidates. While GeodesicCurve lacks a traditional direct antonym, RandomWalk provides strong semantic opposition: geodesics are deterministic, optimal, minimal-length paths governed by geometric principles, while random walks are stochastic, non-optimal, wandering paths with no directional preference. This opposition captures the essence of intentionality vs. aimlessness, optimization vs. randomness. Critically, RandomWalk likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making it immediately usable. For AI safety applications, the geodesic-randomwalk axis could help distinguish between purposeful (potentially deceptive) behavior patterns versus genuinely random or exploratory behaviors."
