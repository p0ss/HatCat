  "opposite_reasoning": "SyntheticProduct provides the strongest and most fundamental semantic opposition to ForestProduct along the natural\u2194artificial dimension. This opposition is: (1) conceptually clear and distinct, (2) maximally separable in semantic space (natural/organic vs synthetic/manufactured), (3) likely to have good representation in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and (4) creates a useful axis for distinguishing natural resource concepts from manufactured ones. The natural vs artificial distinction is more fundamental than ecosystem-based distinctions (forest vs marine) and provides better separation for Fisher-LDA projection."
