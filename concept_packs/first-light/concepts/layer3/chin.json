  "opposite_reasoning": "For anatomical body part concepts like Chin, there is no natural semantic antonym (unlike good/evil or hot/cold). The best approach is complementary anatomical opposition. Forehead provides the strongest within-domain opposite: both are prominent facial features but occupy opposite vertical positions (upper vs lower face). This creates meaningful semantic distance while maintaining anatomical coherence. While steering utility for AI safety is low (body parts are not directly relevant to deception/alignment), Forehead is the most defensible opposite for LDA projection purposes - it maximizes discrimination within the body-part semantic space. Alternative high-level category opposites (AbstractObject, Process) would work technically but lose anatomical specificity."
