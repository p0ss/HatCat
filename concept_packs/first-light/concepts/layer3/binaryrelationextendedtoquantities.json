  "opposite_reasoning": "QualitativeRelation provides the strongest semantic opposition because the defining characteristic of BinaryRelationExtendedToQuantities is its extension to quantitative measurements. The quantitative-qualitative distinction is fundamental and well-established in measurement theory, science, and ontology. This opposition captures the core meaning: relations that work with numerical/measured quantities vs relations that work with qualities, categories, or non-numerical distinctions. While UnaryPredicate offers good arity-based opposition, QualitativeRelation directly opposes the 'extended to quantities' aspect which is the distinguishing feature of this concept."
