  "opposite_reasoning": "Importing is the canonical antonym of Exporting. They form a perfect binary opposition in international trade: Exporting = goods/services going out of a country, Importing = goods/services coming into a country. This opposition has maximum semantic clarity, exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and provides strong directional contrast for Fisher-LDA axes. While the AI safety steering utility is moderate (these are domain-specific economic processes), the opposition strength is maximal and the concept pairing is semantically unambiguous."
