  "opposite_reasoning": "DecompositionRelation provides the strongest semantic opposition as the complementary inverse of CompositionRelation. While CompositionRelation describes how parts combine to form wholes, DecompositionRelation describes how wholes break down into parts. This creates a clear bidirectional opposition useful for Fisher-LDA axes. The opposition is conceptually clean, maintains the same ontological category (relation), and provides meaningful semantic distance. Though it may need to be added to layers if missing, it's a fundamental enough concept to warrant inclusion given that CompositionRelation exists."
