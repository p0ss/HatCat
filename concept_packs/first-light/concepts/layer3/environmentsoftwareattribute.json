  "definition": "The class of attributes which \ncorrespond to environment variables.  Environment variables are defined \noutside of a &%ComputerProgram, unlike ordinary variables that are \ndefined in the source code of the &%ComputerProgram. Typically, the \nenvironment variable stores some value that many if not all \n&%ComputerProgams will need when they execute. An example is the\nenvironment variable PATH under Unix-like operating systems that stores\nthe &%ComputerDirectories where executable &%ComputerPrograms can be found. \nAnother example is the environment variable CLASSPATH for Java programs, \nwhich stores the directory where Java class files can be found that will be \nneeded by any &%ComputerProgram written in Java.",

  "opposite_reasoning": "EnvironmentSoftwareAttribute is fundamentally about EXTERNAL configuration (defined outside the program). The strongest semantic opposite is internal/intrinsic program attributes. While InternalSoftwareAttribute likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents the clearest conceptual opposite that maximizes Fisher-LDA separation. The external\u2194internal dichotomy is: (1) explicitly mentioned in the definition, (2) semantically fundamental to the concept, (3) useful for distinguishing software architecture concepts. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between externally-influenced behavior vs intrinsic program logic."
