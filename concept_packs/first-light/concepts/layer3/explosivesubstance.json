  "opposite_reasoning": "InertSubstance provides the strongest semantic opposition along the chemical reactivity dimension - the fundamental property that defines explosive substances (rapid gas production/energy release) versus inert substances (chemical stability/non-reactivity). This creates a clear spectrum from maximum reactivity to minimum reactivity, which is ideal for Fisher-LDA centroid separation. While it may not exist as a specific term in WordNet, it likely exists in SUMO as a natural complement to reactive/explosive substances in chemical ontologies. The opposition is conceptually clear and scientifically grounded."
