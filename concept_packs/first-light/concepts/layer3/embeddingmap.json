  "opposite_reasoning": "DiscreteSymbol provides the strongest conceptual opposition that's relevant to AI systems. EmbeddingMap represents the modern paradigm of continuous geometric representations (neural networks, word2vec, transformers), while DiscreteSymbol represents the classical symbolic AI paradigm. This opposition captures: (1) continuous vs discrete representation, (2) geometric vs symbolic computation, (3) learned distributed representations vs explicit symbolic tokens. This is ontologically meaningful and likely to exist in SUMO's knowledge representation taxonomy. For AI safety steering, this axis could help distinguish between symbolic reasoning patterns vs embedding-based pattern matching."
