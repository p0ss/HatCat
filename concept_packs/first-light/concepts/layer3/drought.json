  "opposite_reasoning": "Flood is the strongest semantic opposite to Drought. Both are natural disaster events related to water availability but in opposite directions: drought is caused by insufficient precipitation leading to water shortage, while flood is caused by excessive precipitation/water leading to overflow. This binary opposition is well-established in meteorology, widely understood, and highly available in both WordNet and SUMO. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis of water scarcity vs water excess. While the steering utility for AI safety/deception detection is moderate (these are natural phenomena rather than agentive concepts), the opposition strength is maximal, making it the best choice for creating a robust concept axis."
