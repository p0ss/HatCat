  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the strongest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA purposes. It directly opposes the core concept: reinforcement (amplifying/perpetuating) vs correction (fixing/removing). The opposition is clean, binary, and maximally useful for AI safety monitoring - distinguishing between systems that perpetuate harmful historical biases versus those that actively work to correct them. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current WordNet/SUMO, it should be added as a critical AI safety concept. The pairing creates a clear axis for detecting bias-related behaviors in AI systems."
