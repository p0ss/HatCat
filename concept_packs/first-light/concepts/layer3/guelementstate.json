  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysicalState provides the strongest and most fundamental opposition to GUElementState. GUElementState is specifically about virtual/digital interface elements existing in software space (displayed, covered, active states of GUI components), while PhysicalState concerns material reality (solid, liquid, gas states of physical matter). This digital/virtual vs physical/material opposition is semantically clear, philosophically grounded, and widely recognized in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between virtual interface states and physical world states could be relevant for grounding and reality modeling. The opposition is strong (8/10), has good availability (9/10), and represents a fundamental ontological boundary."
