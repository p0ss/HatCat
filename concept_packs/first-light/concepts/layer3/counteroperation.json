  "opposite_reasoning": "Insurgency is the optimal opposite because it represents the exact phenomenon that CounterOperation is defined against ('actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency'). This creates a natural complementary opposition: one is the threat, the other is the response. For Fisher-LDA, this pairing maximizes semantic distance while maintaining conceptual coherence - counter-operation documents/embeddings should cluster far from insurgency documents. For AI safety monitoring, this distinction is valuable for understanding whether a system is reasoning about security threats versus security responses. The opposition is strong, well-defined in both WordNet and SUMO, and highly relevant to the military/security domain."
