  "opposite_reasoning": "While Graph doesn't have a direct antonym, Chaos provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. Graph represents ordered, systematic, coordinate-based structures with explicit relationships and organization. Chaos represents complete disorder, randomness, and absence of structure. This opposition captures the fundamental dimension of order vs. disorder, which is valuable for concept steering. Chaos has high availability (exists in both WordNet and SUMO), strong opposition strength (8/10), and reasonable confidence (6/10). For AI safety applications, distinguishing structured reasoning (graph-like) from chaotic/disordered thinking could be useful. Alternative: 'Unstructured' is also strong and may be more directly relevant to data representation contexts, but has lower availability in existing ontologies."
