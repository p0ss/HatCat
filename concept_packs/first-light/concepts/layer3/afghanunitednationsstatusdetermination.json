  "opposite_reasoning": "Given the highly specific nature of AfghanUnitedNationsStatusDetermination (a domain-specific administrative process), no direct antonym exists. Among candidates, PhysicalObject provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes: (1) Guaranteed availability in both WordNet and SUMO, (2) Clear ontological separation (abstract process vs concrete entity), (3) Maximum distributional distance while remaining semantically principled. While DomesticAutonomousStatusGranting offers better domain-specific opposition, its unavailability and uncertainty make it impractical. For AI safety monitoring, contrasting abstract bureaucratic processes with physical objects can help distinguish between procedural reasoning and object-level cognition."
