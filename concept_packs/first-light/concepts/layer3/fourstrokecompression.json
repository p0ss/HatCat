  "opposite_reasoning": "Expansion provides the strongest general semantic opposition to compression with high availability in both WordNet and SUMO. While FourStrokeExhaust is conceptually related as a complementary cycle phase, Expansion captures the core physical opposite (volume increase vs. decrease, pressure decrease vs. increase) that defines the fundamental nature of compression. This makes it more robust for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring, as it represents true semantic opposition rather than just sequential difference in a process cycle. Expansion is also more generalizable and likely to create clearer separation in concept space."
