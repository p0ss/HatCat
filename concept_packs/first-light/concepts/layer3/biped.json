  "opposite_reasoning": "Quadruped is the strongest opposite for Biped - it represents the most common and direct anatomical contrast (four-legged vs two-legged locomotion). This is a well-established binary distinction in biology and ontology. Both terms exist in WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis distinguishing between two major locomotion categories in the animal kingdom. While this has limited direct relevance to AI safety concerns like deception detection, it serves as a strong structural anchor for biological categorization tasks."
