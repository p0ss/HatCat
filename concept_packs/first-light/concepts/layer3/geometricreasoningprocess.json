  "opposite_reasoning": "SymbolicReasoningProcess provides the strongest opposition for AI safety monitoring purposes. It represents a fundamental dichotomy in AI reasoning paradigms: geometric/subsymbolic (neural networks, embeddings, continuous representations) vs symbolic (rule-based, discrete, logical). This distinction is crucial for understanding different AI processing modes. It likely already exists in SUMO ontology, has high relevance to AI safety (understanding whether a system is using geometric pattern matching vs logical reasoning), and represents a well-established complementary pair in cognitive science and AI research. The opposition is particularly useful for Fisher-LDA because it captures fundamentally different cognitive processing architectures."
