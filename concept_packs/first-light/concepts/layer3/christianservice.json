  "opposite_reasoning": "ChristianService represents religious worship in sacred contexts. The most semantically meaningful opposite is SecularActivity, which captures the fundamental sacred\u2194secular distinction. This opposition is: (1) conceptually clear and well-established in religious studies, (2) likely to exist in SUMO's ontology given its coverage of religious concepts, (3) useful for distinguishing religious from non-religious domains in concept space. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it provides strong category-level separation for Fisher-LDA. The sacred/secular divide is a fundamental ontological distinction that should create clear separation in embedding space."
