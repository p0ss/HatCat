  "opposite_reasoning": "Perception is the strongest opposite for Hallucination in its correct psychiatric/neurological sense (false sensory experience vs. genuine sensory experience). This pairing: (1) Has maximal opposition strength for the reality\u2194unreality dimension, (2) Is highly available in both WordNet and SUMO, (3) Has exceptional steering utility for AI safety - distinguishing when models are 'perceiving' (processing real inputs accurately) vs. 'hallucinating' (generating false information), (4) Works across both visual and linguistic modalities. If the definition is actually meant to be 'delusion' (erroneous belief), Knowledge would be better, but standard usage of 'Hallucination' in AI safety literature refers to perceptual/generative falsity, making Perception the optimal anchor."
