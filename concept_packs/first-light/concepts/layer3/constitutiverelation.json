  "opposite_reasoning": "ConstitutiveRelation captures deep ontological dependency where one entity realizes/constitutes another (substrate-to-process). The strongest semantic opposite is IndependentRelation, representing relations between entities that maintain separate existence without one being the constitutional basis of the other. This provides maximum Fisher-LDA separation for detecting whether AI systems are reasoning about constitutive dependencies (physical substrate \u2192 computational process) vs. independent entity relations. For AI safety, distinguishing constitutive from independent relations helps monitor whether systems correctly understand their own substrate dependencies vs. treating all relations as external/independent."
