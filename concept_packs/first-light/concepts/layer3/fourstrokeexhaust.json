  "opposite_reasoning": "FourStrokeIntake is the strongest semantic opposite for FourStrokeExhaust. They represent complementary phases of the same four-stroke engine cycle with opposite directional flows (intake draws in, exhaust expels) and opposite positions in the operational sequence. This creates a well-defined opposition within the same ontological domain, ideal for Fisher-LDA where the negative centroid should represent a meaningful contrast. While this pairing has low AI safety utility (it's domain-specific mechanical engineering), it provides the clearest semantic opposition for the concept axis."
