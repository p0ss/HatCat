  "opposite_reasoning": "While CommunityDetectionProcess lacks a standard antonym, NetworkIntegrationProcess provides the strongest semantic opposition by representing the inverse operation: partitioning/dividing vs integrating/unifying network structures. This complementary relationship is highly relevant for Fisher-LDA as it captures the fundamental directional difference in network analysis goals. The opposition is conceptually clean and meaningful for steering purposes, even though it may need to be added to the ontology layers."
