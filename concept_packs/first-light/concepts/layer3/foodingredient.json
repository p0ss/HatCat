  "opposite_reasoning": "Poison provides the strongest functional opposition to FoodIngredient. While FoodIngredient lacks a direct antonym, the edible/nutritious\u2194toxic/harmful dimension is semantically robust and highly relevant for AI safety applications. This opposition captures the critical distinction between substances meant for beneficial consumption versus harmful substances. The pairing is more specific and functionally meaningful than broader oppositions like InorganicSubstance. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear axis separating safe consumables from dangerous substances, which has obvious utility for safety monitoring and classification tasks."
