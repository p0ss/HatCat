  "opposite_reasoning": "While PassiveObject has the strongest opposition on agency dimensions, HumanAgent provides the most practical utility for AI safety monitoring. The AI\u2194Human distinction is critical for: (1) detecting AI impersonation of humans, (2) distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated content, (3) monitoring AI alignment with human values, and (4) identifying boundary violations where AI systems claim human-like agency inappropriately. This opposition captures both the artificial\u2194natural dimension and provides actionable steering for safety applications. HumanAgent is highly likely to exist in SUMO as a fundamental concept."
