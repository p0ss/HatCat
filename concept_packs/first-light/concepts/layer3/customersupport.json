  "opposite_reasoning": "SelfService provides the strongest practical opposition for Fisher-LDA because it represents a clear complementary relationship: human-mediated organizational assistance vs. autonomous customer action. This opposition is conceptually clean (support provided by representatives vs. no organizational representatives involved), has high availability in existing ontologies, and is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring contexts where distinguishing between organizational intervention and autonomous action matters. The dimension captures whether an organizational unit is customer-facing with active assistance vs. customer-independent processes."
