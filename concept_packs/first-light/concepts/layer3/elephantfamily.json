  "opposite_reasoning": "PlantKingdom provides the strongest semantic opposition while maintaining ontological coherence. It represents a fundamental biological division (Animalia vs Plantae) that creates maximum separation in the Fisher-LDA space. This opposition is: (1) well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, (2) represents clear complementary categories at the kingdom level, (3) provides strong distributional distance for concept axis formation. While ElephantFamily doesn't have a direct antonym (it's a specific biological taxon), kingdom-level opposition offers the most principled and interpretable negative anchor. The natural vs artificial divide (ArtifactObject) is also strong but less biologically coherent for a biological family classification."
