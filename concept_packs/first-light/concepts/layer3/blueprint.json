  "opposite_reasoning": "FinalProduct provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. Blueprint represents the planning/design phase (prescriptive, future-oriented, abstract plan), while FinalProduct represents the actualized result (descriptive, present/past-oriented, concrete realization). This temporal and functional opposition creates meaningful semantic distance. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between planning/intention vs. execution/outcome, which is relevant for understanding agent behavior. The opposition is clear, interpretable, and likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies."
