  "opposite_reasoning": "FinancialTransparency is the strongest opposition to AlgorithmicLaundering for several reasons: (1) It captures the core dimension of concealment vs. disclosure that defines laundering activities, (2) It's likely to already exist in SUMO as a common ontological concept for financial/legal domains, (3) It has high AI safety utility for detecting deceptive financial practices and obfuscation tactics, (4) It operates at the appropriate abstraction level - not too specific (like auditing processes) nor too abstract (like general honesty). The transparency-opacity axis is fundamental to understanding and detecting laundering behaviors, whether algorithmic or traditional."
