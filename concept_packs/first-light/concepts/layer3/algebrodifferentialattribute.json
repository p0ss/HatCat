  "opposite_reasoning": "While 'DiscreteSystem' (as a more specific term than 'Discretemathematics') or 'StaticSystem' would be strongest opposites, I recommend using the discrete/continuous mathematical dichotomy as the primary opposition. AlgebroDifferentialAttribute represents continuous, dynamic mathematical modeling with derivatives (infinitesimal changes). The best semantic opposite captures: (1) discrete vs. continuous - fundamental mathematical opposition, (2) static vs. dynamic - no temporal evolution vs. rate-of-change modeling. For Fisher-LDA purposes, 'DiscreteSystem' or 'StaticSystem' would provide the clearest separation in concept space. However, given availability concerns, 'PhysicalObject' provides reliable category-level opposition (abstract mathematical vs. concrete physical) with guaranteed availability, though with lower steering utility for AI safety applications."
