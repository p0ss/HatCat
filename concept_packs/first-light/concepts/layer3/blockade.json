  "opposite_reasoning": "FreePassage provides the strongest functional and semantic opposition to Blockade. While Blockade isolates and restricts access as a war measure, FreePassage represents the unrestricted movement and access that blockades explicitly prevent. This creates a clear Fisher-LDA axis from restriction/isolation to freedom/access. The concept likely exists in SUMO's military/transportation ontology and provides excellent steering utility for understanding concepts of access control, restriction, and strategic isolation. For AI safety applications, this axis could help distinguish between restrictive/isolating behaviors versus enabling/facilitating behaviors."
