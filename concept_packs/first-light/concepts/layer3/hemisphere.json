  "opposite_reasoning": "Hemisphere is a highly specific geographic/geometric concept with no direct antonym. Among the candidates, Point provides the strongest semantic opposition based on spatial extent: Hemisphere represents maximal regional division (half of a sphere, enormous 3D volume), while Point represents minimal spatial extent (0-dimensional location). This creates a meaningful opposition axis for Fisher-LDA that captures the scale/extent dimension. While not directly relevant to AI safety concerns like deception, it provides mathematically coherent separation in the concept space. The part-whole opposition (Hemisphere vs. WholeEntity) is conceptually strong but less ontologically clean since 'the whole' of which hemisphere is part would be 'Globe' or 'Planet', not a general category."
