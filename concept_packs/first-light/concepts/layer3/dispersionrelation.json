  "opposite_reasoning": "DispersionRelation is a highly technical physics concept describing frequency-dependent wave propagation. It lacks a natural antonym. ConstantRelation provides the best semantic opposition by contrasting variability (dispersion across frequencies) with invariance (constant across parameters). It likely exists in SUMO as part of mathematical/logical relation hierarchies and provides clearer opposition than purely spatial or temporal relations. However, this is a weak pairing overall due to the specialized nature of the source concept."
