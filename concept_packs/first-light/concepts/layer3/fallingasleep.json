  "opposite_reasoning": "WakingUp is the strongest opposite for FallingAsleep as it represents the exact reverse state transition in the sleep-wake cycle. Both are processes/events of similar semantic structure (state transitions), making them ideal anchors for Fisher-LDA. The opposition is clear, natural, and maximally separable in semantic space. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between sleep-wake transitions may be relevant for understanding agent state awareness and consciousness-related concepts. WakingUp likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies."
