  "opposite_reasoning": "PhysiologicalProcess provides the strongest semantic opposition within the domain of biological processes. The key distinction is: EmotionalBehavioralProcess = expressive, observable, emotionally-driven behaviors (crying, laughing, facial expressions) vs PhysiologicalProcess = automatic, involuntary, internal biological functions. This opposition is meaningful for Fisher-LDA because it separates conscious behavioral manifestations from unconscious biological operations. For AI safety applications, this helps distinguish between observable emotional/behavioral signals (which could indicate deception, stress, or alignment issues) from baseline physiological states. The opposition is well-established in SUMO ontology and provides clear semantic distance while remaining within a coherent conceptual domain."
