  "opposite_reasoning": "EnergyInefficiency provides the strongest semantic opposition along the primary dimension being measured (efficiency vs. inefficiency). While EuropeanUnionEnergyLabelClass is specifically a classification system, its purpose is to distinguish efficient from inefficient devices. This makes efficiency/inefficiency the most meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA discrimination. The concept is likely to exist in WordNet and provides clear directional opposition for the spectrum being measured. For AI safety steering, this helps establish boundaries between optimized/efficient behaviors and wasteful/inefficient ones."
