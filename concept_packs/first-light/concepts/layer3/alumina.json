  "opposite_reasoning": "Alumina is a highly specific chemical substance (aluminum oxide mineral). Since it has no direct antonym, the best semantic opposite is OrganicCompound, which represents the fundamental chemical taxonomy divide between inorganic minerals and organic (carbon-based) compounds. This opposition is: (1) scientifically meaningful and widely recognized in chemistry, (2) captures a fundamental categorical distinction, (3) likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, (4) provides maximal semantic distance for Fisher-LDA axis construction. While this has limited AI safety utility (steering_utility=3), for a specialized chemical term like Alumina, the goal is semantic coherence rather than safety relevance. The inorganic-organic divide is the strongest available opposition."
