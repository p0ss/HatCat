  "opposite_reasoning": "Biology provides the strongest conceptual opposition to Electronics for Fisher-LDA purposes. It captures multiple important dimensions: (1) natural vs. artificial systems, (2) organic vs. inorganic substrates, (3) evolved vs. designed systems, and (4) animate vs. inanimate processing. This opposition is particularly relevant for AI safety contexts where distinguishing between biological and artificial intelligence systems may be important. Biology is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO, making it readily available. While Mechanics is a more direct physics-domain complement, Biology provides richer semantic distance and more relevance to AI alignment questions about natural vs. artificial cognition."
