  "opposite_reasoning": "Contraction provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes: it represents the inverse physical process (reduction vs. expansion of volume). While 'Deflation' is more specific to gas reduction, 'Contraction' is more likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies with broader coverage. It creates a clear spectrum axis from contracted/reduced volume to expanded/bloated volume. For AI safety monitoring, this axis has limited direct utility but provides clean geometric separation for medical/biological concept spaces."
