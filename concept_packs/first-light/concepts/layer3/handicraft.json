  "opposite_reasoning": "Handicraft lacks a direct antonym, but the strongest semantic opposition lies along the production method axis: handcrafted with individual skill vs mass-produced by machines. 'MassProducedArticle' best captures this opposition, representing standardized, mechanized production without individual craftsmanship. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents a meaningful and useful distinction for concept space organization. For Fisher-LDA, this opposition would create a clear axis separating artisanal/manual creation from industrial/automated production."
