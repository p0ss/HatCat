  "opposite_reasoning": "BackOfHead provides the strongest semantic opposition for Forehead as they are mutually exclusive, spatially opposite regions of the same anatomical structure (the head). This complementary relationship creates a clear anterior-posterior axis that would be useful for Fisher-LDA separation. While this opposition has limited direct utility for AI safety/deception detection, it represents the most coherent and defensible opposite for a specific anatomical body part. The opposition is based on spatial orientation rather than function, making it a natural complementary pair."
