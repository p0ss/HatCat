  "opposite_reasoning": "BackOffice provides the strongest semantic opposition for HotelFrontDesk within organizational context. It captures the fundamental front/back, public/private, customer-facing/internal dichotomy that is conceptually clear and functionally meaningful. This opposition would be useful for Fisher-LDA as it distinguishes between external-facing service entities and internal operational entities. While not directly related to deception detection, it establishes useful spatial and functional boundaries in organizational ontology. The concept is likely in WordNet and should be added to SUMO if missing."
