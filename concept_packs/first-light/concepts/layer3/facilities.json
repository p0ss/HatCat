  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalLandFeature provides the strongest and most semantically coherent opposition to Facilities. The built vs. natural distinction is fundamental in spatial and geographical ontology. This pairing creates a clear axis: human-constructed, purpose-designed installations (facilities) versus naturally-occurring geographical formations (natural land features). This opposition is conceptually clean, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides useful semantic separation for Fisher-LDA projection. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it offers robust concept differentiation for spatial/physical entity classification. The opposition strength is high (9/10) because these represent mutually exclusive origins and formation processes for physical geographical entities."
