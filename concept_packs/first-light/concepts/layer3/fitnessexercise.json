  "opposite_reasoning": "Resting is the most natural and well-established opposite to FitnessExercise. It represents the complementary state in the activity-rest cycle that is fundamental to exercise physiology. While Sedentariness might capture a stronger lifestyle opposition, Resting is more likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, has clearer semantic boundaries, and provides a clean process-to-process opposition. The FitnessExercise\u2194Resting axis would effectively separate intentional physical exertion from recuperative inactivity, which is conceptually coherent for Fisher-LDA steering."
