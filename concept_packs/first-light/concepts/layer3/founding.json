  "opposite_reasoning": "Destruction is the strongest semantic opposite to Founding along the creation-annihilation axis. It provides maximum separation in semantic space for Fisher-LDA, as founding (establishing, creating, initiating) and destruction (dismantling, eliminating, abolishing) represent fundamental opposite processes. This opposition is: (1) universally recognized with clear WordNet antonym relationships, (2) strongly represented in SUMO ontology, (3) maximally distant in semantic space while maintaining meaningful opposition, (4) useful for AI safety monitoring as it distinguishes constructive from destructive processes. The binary opposition is clean and unambiguous, making it ideal for centroid anchoring."
