  "opposite_reasoning": "Disbelieving is the strongest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. It represents the direct negation of the cognitive attitude in Believing - where Believing is accepting a proposition as true, Disbelieving is rejecting it as true. This binary opposition provides maximum separation in concept space (\u03bc+ - \u03bc-), which is ideal for creating effective steering vectors. For AI safety applications, the Believing\u2194Disbelieving axis is crucial for monitoring epistemic states, confidence calibration, and detecting when models inappropriately accept or reject claims. While 'Doubting' is also strong, Disbelieving represents a clearer binary opposite rather than an intermediate uncertainty state."
