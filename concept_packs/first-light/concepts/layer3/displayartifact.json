  "opposite_reasoning": "HiddenObject provides the strongest semantic opposition for AI safety steering purposes. DisplayArtifact's core function is public visibility and communication (signs, posters, boards), making it fundamentally about exposure and transparency. HiddenObject represents the opposite intent - concealment. This creates a highly relevant axis for deception detection and transparency monitoring. The public-display vs concealment dimension is more meaningful for safety applications than artifact vs natural or physical vs abstract distinctions. While HiddenObject may need to be added to layers, its high steering utility justifies this."
