  "opposite_reasoning": "DisabilityLeave represents a state where an employee cannot work due to medical conditions. The best opposite is 'ActiveEmployment' - the state of being productively engaged in work with full functional capacity. This captures the core opposition: inability to work (due to disease/syndrome) versus active, capable work engagement. While this concept may not exist explicitly in WordNet/SUMO, it represents the clearest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA purposes. The opposition is strong and meaningful: someone on disability leave is by definition NOT in active employment, and vice versa. For AI safety monitoring, this axis could help distinguish between normal work states and medical leave states."
