  "opposite_reasoning": "NondurableGood is the natural taxonomic complement to DurableGood within product classification systems. It provides the strongest semantic opposition (durable vs non-durable) and likely exists in both WordNet (nondurable_good.n.01) and SUMO as the complementary Product subclass. This creates a clean binary partition for Fisher-LDA: items designed to last 3+ years vs items designed for shorter lifespan. The opposition is strong, conceptually clear, and standardized in economic/product taxonomies. While steering utility for AI safety is moderate (not directly related to deception/alignment), it provides excellent concept separation for general ontological understanding."
