  "opposite_reasoning": "FilmWatching provides the most semantically coherent opposition to FilmMaking within the domain of motion pictures. It represents the complementary process in the content lifecycle: production vs. consumption. This pairing would be valuable for Fisher-LDA axes distinguishing between creative/productive activities and receptive/consumptive activities. While it may not exist in current ontologies, it's a natural concept that should exist symmetrically with FilmMaking. The opposition is strong enough for steering purposes and maintains domain relevance."
