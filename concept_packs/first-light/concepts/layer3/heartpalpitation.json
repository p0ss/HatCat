  "opposite_reasoning": "HeartPalpitation is explicitly defined as an abnormality of the HeartBeat - fast, hard, irregular, and notably perceived. The most semantically coherent opposite is NormalHeartBeat, representing regular cardiac rhythm that operates below conscious awareness. This provides the clearest axis: abnormal/perceived vs. normal/unconscious cardiac activity. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful physiological state axis that would help distinguish between pathological and healthy cardiac manifestations. While it may not directly relate to AI safety monitoring for deception, it provides a clean medical symptom axis."
