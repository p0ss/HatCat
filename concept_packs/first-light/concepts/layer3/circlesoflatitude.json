  "definition": "A &%CirclesOfLatitude an abstract east\u2013west \nsmall circle connecting all locations around Earth (ignoring elevation) at a given latitude \ncoordinate line.Circles of latitude are often called parallels because they are parallel to \neach other; that is, planes that contain any of these circles never intersect each other. \nA location's position along a circle of latitude is given by its longitude.There are five major \ncircles of latitude from north to south are: &%ArticCircle, &%TropicOfCancer, &%Equator, \n&%TropicOfCapricorn &%AnarticCircle. The position of the Equator is fixed (90 degrees from \nEarth's axis of rotation) but the latitudes of the other circles depend on the tilt of this \naxis relative to the plane of Earth's orbit, and so are not perfectly fixed.

  "opposite_reasoning": "CirclesOfLongitude (meridians) is the strongest semantic opposite because it represents the orthogonal complement in Earth's coordinate system. Together, latitude and longitude circles form the complete basis for geographic positioning - they are mutually necessary, geometrically perpendicular, and represent the two fundamental dimensions of surface navigation. This complementary relationship (east-west parallels vs north-south converging meridians) provides maximum semantic distance while maintaining coherent ontological structure. The opposition is well-defined, mathematically precise, and likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO as they represent fundamental geographic concepts taught together."
