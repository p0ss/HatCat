  "definition": "A nerve is an enclosed, cable_like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons)\nin the peripheral nervous system. Axons transmit electrical impulses. Nerves have historically been considered\nthe basic units of the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical\nnerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or,\nin the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. Each axon, within the\nnerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that\ncoat the axons in myelin. Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the\nendoneurium. The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a\nlayer of connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective\ntissue called the epineurium. Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves.\nIn the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts.[from Wikipedia]",
