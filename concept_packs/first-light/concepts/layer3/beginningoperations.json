  "opposite_reasoning": "CeasingOperations is the strongest choice because: (1) it uses parallel grammatical structure to BeginningOperations, maintaining ontological consistency; (2) it represents a true binary temporal opposition (lifecycle start vs. lifecycle end); (3) it's likely to exist in SUMO as the standardized term for this concept; (4) for Fisher-LDA, the contrast between organizational inception and termination provides maximum semantic separation. While GoingOutOfBusiness is more colloquial and exists in WordNet, CeasingOperations better matches SUMO's formal naming conventions."
