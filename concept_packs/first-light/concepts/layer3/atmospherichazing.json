  "opposite_reasoning": "ClearWeather is the strongest opposite for AtmosphericHazing because it represents the complementary state on the atmospheric visibility spectrum. While AtmosphericHazing involves suspended particles reducing visibility to 2-5km, ClearWeather represents unobscured conditions with high visibility. This opposition is semantically clear, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO (as a common weather concept), and provides strong discriminative power for Fisher-LDA. The concept pair captures the fundamental obscured/clear atmospheric dichotomy. For AI safety monitoring, while not directly related to deception/alignment, visibility/clarity vs. obscuration could serve as useful metaphorical anchors for transparency concepts."
