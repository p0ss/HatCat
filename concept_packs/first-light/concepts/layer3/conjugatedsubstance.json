  "opposite_reasoning": "ElementalSubstance provides the strongest semantic opposition to ConjugatedSubstance. The opposition is clear and well-grounded in chemistry: conjugated substances are created by synthesizing multiple compounds together (increasing molecular complexity), while elemental substances are fundamental, non-decomposable entities (maximum simplicity). This creates a strong axis from 'complex synthesized compounds' to 'fundamental elements' that is taxonomically valid, semantically clear, and likely well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. For Fisher-LDA steering, this axis would effectively separate complex synthetic chemistry from fundamental elemental chemistry."
