  "opposite_reasoning": "Defense is the optimal opposite for Attack because: (1) It maintains the same semantic category (military event/action) ensuring dimensional coherence for Fisher-LDA, (2) It represents the fundamental strategic dichotomy in military contexts - offensive vs. defensive posture, (3) Both concepts exist robustly in WordNet and SUMO with similar categorical structure, (4) For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing attack from defense behaviors is highly relevant for identifying aggressive vs. protective patterns, (5) The opposition is strong, consistent, and widely understood across military, strategic, and metaphorical contexts. Defense provides maximum separation in concept space while maintaining categorical alignment."
