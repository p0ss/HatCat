  "opposite_reasoning": "Cytoplasm provides the strongest complementary opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes: CellEnvelope represents the rigid boundary/container structure, while Cytoplasm represents the fluid interior contents. This boundary-vs-interior opposition creates clear semantic separation that would be useful for concept axis construction. Both concepts are well-established in biological ontologies, ensuring high availability. While this opposition has limited direct AI safety implications, it provides a clean structural contrast for the concept space."
