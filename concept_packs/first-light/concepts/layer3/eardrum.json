  "definition": "In the anatomy of humans and various other tetrapods, the eardrum,\nalso called the tympanic membrane or myringa, is a thin, cone_shaped membrane that separates the external ear\nfrom the middle ear. Its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear,\nand then to the oval window in the fluid_filled cochlea. Hence, it ultimately converts and amplifies\nvibration in the air to vibration in cochlear fluid. The &%MalleusBone bridges the gap between the\neardrum and the other ossicles. Rupture or perforation of the eardrum can lead to conductive hearing loss.\nCollapse or retraction of the eardrum can cause conductive hearing loss or cholesteatoma. [from Wikipedia]",
