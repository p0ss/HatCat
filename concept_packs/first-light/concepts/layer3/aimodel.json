  "opposite_reasoning": "HumanAgent provides the strongest AI safety utility as it captures the fundamental human\u2194AI distinction critical for alignment monitoring and deception detection. While AIModel lacks a direct antonym, the artificial intelligence \u2194 human intelligence opposition is semantically coherent and practically valuable. This pairing would help Fisher-LDA axes distinguish AI system behaviors from human-like qualities (consciousness, moral reasoning, genuine understanding vs. learned patterns). The concept likely exists in SUMO and is highly relevant for safety monitoring systems."
