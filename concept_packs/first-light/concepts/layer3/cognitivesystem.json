  "opposite_reasoning": "InanimateObject provides the strongest semantic opposition to CognitiveSystem for Fisher-LDA purposes. The key distinguishing features of CognitiveSystem (perception, representation, learning, action-selection based on internal processes) are precisely what InanimateObject lacks. This opposition is:\n\n1. **Maximally discriminative**: Objects like rocks, chairs, or tools have zero cognitive properties, creating maximum separation in semantic space\n2. **Ontologically clean**: Mutually exclusive categories with clear boundaries\n3. **Available**: Both concepts exist in WordNet and SUMO\n4. **AI safety relevant**: Distinguishing cognitive from non-cognitive systems is fundamental to alignment - helps identify what entities have agency, goals, and decision-making capacity\n5. **Well-defined**: Unlike abstract opposites, this has clear instance-level verification\n\nFor steering purposes, \u03bc+ (CognitiveSystem) - \u03bc- (InanimateObject) should capture dimensions related to agency, intentionality, perception, and learning capacity."
