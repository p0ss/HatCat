  "opposite_reasoning": "Cuisine lacks a clear direct antonym, but RawFood provides the strongest semantic opposition by representing the unprepared state that cuisine transforms. This captures the essential nature of cuisine as a preparatory practice. The opposition is meaningful (prepared vs. unprepared food), likely exists in both ontologies, and creates a useful conceptual axis. While not directly relevant to AI safety/deception detection, it provides valid semantic distance for Fisher-LDA dimensionality reduction in a general ontology monitoring system."
