  "opposite_reasoning": "DeliberativeProcess is the most suitable opposite because: (1) It represents the established cognitive science distinction between fast/intuitive and slow/deliberative thinking (dual-process theory), (2) It's more likely to exist in SUMO than compound terms, (3) For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between quick heuristic responses and careful deliberation is crucial for detecting when systems are taking shortcuts vs engaging in thorough reasoning, (4) It captures the core opposition across multiple dimensions: speed (fast\u2194slow), depth (shallow\u2194deep), control (automatic\u2194controlled). This is particularly relevant for alignment monitoring where we want to detect if an AI is using quick heuristics to bypass safety constraints vs engaging in proper deliberative reasoning."
