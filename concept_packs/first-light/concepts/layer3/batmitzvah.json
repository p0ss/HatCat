  "opposite_reasoning": "BatMitzvah is a highly specific cultural-religious ceremony without a true antonym. Among available options, Funeral provides the strongest semantic opposition through life-cycle complementarity: both are ceremonial events marking major life transitions, but Funeral represents the end of life while BatMitzvah celebrates the beginning of religious adulthood. This opposition is intuitive, likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO, and creates a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA. While not directly relevant to AI safety/deception detection, it provides the cleanest semantic contrast for this concept. Alternative complementary opposites (Excommunication, Apostasy) are stronger on the inclusion/exclusion dimension but less likely to be well-represented in standard ontologies."
