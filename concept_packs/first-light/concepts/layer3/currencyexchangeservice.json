  "opposite_reasoning": "Barter provides the strongest semantic opposition to CurrencyExchangeService by representing a fundamentally different exchange mechanism - direct goods/services swap without monetary intermediation vs. converting between currency forms. This opposition captures the currency-mediated vs. non-currency-mediated distinction in exchange systems. While not a perfect antonym, it offers meaningful contrast for Fisher-LDA separation. Barter likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies as a fundamental economic concept, providing high availability. The opposition is semantically coherent and represents genuinely different transaction categories."
