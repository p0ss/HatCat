  "opposite_reasoning": "Backlash is the clear direct opposite of Backlashless - it represents the mechanical property that backlashless systems are specifically designed to eliminate. This is a textbook binary opposition where one term is literally the negation of the other. While this has limited utility for AI safety applications (low steering utility score), it provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA separation in the mechanical/engineering domain. The opposition is clean, well-defined, and would create a clear axis in concept space."
