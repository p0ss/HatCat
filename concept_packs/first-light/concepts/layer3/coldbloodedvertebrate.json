  "opposite_reasoning": "WarmBloodedVertebrate is the ideal semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. It provides: (1) Perfect binary opposition on the thermoregulation dimension, (2) Parallel structure at the same ontological level (both are attributes of vertebrates at Layer 3), (3) Clear mutual exclusivity - no vertebrate is both warm and cold-blooded, (4) Strong linguistic and conceptual clarity for interpretability. While the steering utility for AI safety/deception is moderate (6/10) since this is a biological rather than ethical/behavioral distinction, the opposition strength (10/10) makes it excellent for demonstrating clear conceptual boundaries in the embedding space. The \u03bc+ - \u03bc- vector will cleanly separate endothermic from ectothermic organisms."
