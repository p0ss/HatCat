  "opposite_reasoning": "Poison provides the strongest semantic opposition to FoodProduct with high availability. While FoodProduct sustains life and health through nutrition, Poison harms or destroys life through toxicity. Both are substances that can be ingested, making them comparable on that dimension while being maximally opposed in function and intent. This opposition is particularly relevant for AI safety in contexts like food labeling, safety classification, and distinguishing beneficial from harmful substances. Poison exists in both WordNet and SUMO, ensuring compatibility with existing ontologies."
