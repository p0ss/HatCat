  "opposite_reasoning": "Observing provides the strongest complementary opposition to DramaticActing_Embody. The performer\u2194audience duality is fundamental to dramatic arts and creates a clean, intuitive opposition. This pairing captures the essential distinction between active performance/projection and passive reception/witnessing. It has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides good steering utility for distinguishing active expression from passive perception. While Concealing scores higher on safety utility and Authenticity captures the pretense\u2194genuineness dimension, Observing offers the most robust and complementary opposition for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring."
