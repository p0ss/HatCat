  "opposite_reasoning": "Person provides the strongest and most meaningful opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. The Organization-Individual axis is fundamental across many domains and highly relevant for AI safety applications. This opposition captures: (1) Institutional vs. individual agency, (2) Corporate vs. personal identity, (3) Collective vs. singular entity structure. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing institutional behavior from individual behavior is crucial for understanding responsibility, decision-making authority, and liability. The concept is guaranteed to exist in both WordNet and SUMO, is already in standard ontologies, and provides high-quality semantic distance without being arbitrary. While InformalFinancialExchange might provide stronger domain-specific opposition, its likely absence from standard resources and lower confidence makes Person the more reliable choice."
