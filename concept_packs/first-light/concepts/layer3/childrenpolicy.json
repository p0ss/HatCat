  "opposite_reasoning": "NoChildrenPolicy is the strongest candidate because: (1) It's explicitly documented as a Category Child of ChildrenPolicy in SUMO, indicating an ontological relationship; (2) It represents a true binary complementary opposition - policies allowing children vs. prohibiting children; (3) It exists in SUMO and operates in the same semantic domain; (4) For Fisher-LDA, this creates a clear discriminative axis for policy stance on children in establishments. The opposition is clean, interpretable, and maximally relevant to the concept's purpose."
