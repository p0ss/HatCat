  "opposite_reasoning": "DataBreach provides the strongest practical opposition for AI safety monitoring. BindingCorporateRules represent proactive, structured compliance mechanisms for data protection, while DataBreach represents the failure state - unauthorized access/disclosure of protected data. This opposition is highly relevant for: (1) monitoring compliance vs. violation behaviors, (2) detecting shifts from protective to harmful data practices, (3) AI alignment around data governance. DataBreach is likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, making it practically available. The opposition captures both the protective/harmful dimension and the compliance/violation dimension simultaneously."
