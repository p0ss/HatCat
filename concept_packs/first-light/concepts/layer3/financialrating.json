  "opposite_reasoning": "FinancialRating is fundamentally about probabilistic prediction and assessment of future events (bond default). ActualOccurrence provides the strongest semantic opposition as it represents events that have definitively occurred rather than probability assessments. This distinction between prediction/assessment vs realized fact creates meaningful semantic distance for Fisher-LDA. While not a classic antonym, it captures the core opposition between predictive evaluation and actual outcome. It exists in SUMO and provides reasonable steering utility for distinguishing assessment from reality."
