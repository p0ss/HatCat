  "opposite_reasoning": "TwoStrokeEngineCycle is the strongest semantic opposite for FourStrokeEngineCycle. They are mutually exclusive, taxonomically complementary engine cycle types that represent the primary bifurcation in internal combustion engine design. This provides clear geometric separation for Fisher-LDA while maintaining semantic coherence. The opposition is well-defined in engineering contexts and likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. While this has limited AI safety utility (low relevance to deception/alignment), it provides the most principled and robust opposition for this technical concept."
