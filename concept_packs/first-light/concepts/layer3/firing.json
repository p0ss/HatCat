  "opposite_reasoning": "Hiring is the clearest and strongest semantic opposite to Firing. Both are OrganizationalProcesses at the boundaries of employment: Hiring represents entry into an organization while Firing represents involuntary exit. This binary opposition provides maximum separation for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. The pair captures the complete employment lifecycle spectrum at its endpoints. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between hiring/firing processes could be relevant for detecting organizational manipulation or understanding employment-related deception. Hiring likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies and should definitely be included in the layers system."
