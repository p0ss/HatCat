  "opposite_reasoning": "Obscuring is the strongest opposite for Commenting because it directly opposes the core purpose: Commenting makes meaning clearer through explanation and interpretation, while Obscuring makes meaning less clear. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety applications, as it relates to transparency vs. deception/obfuscation - a key concern in alignment monitoring. The clarification vs. obscuration axis is fundamental to understanding whether an AI system is being helpful and honest or deliberately unclear. This has high opposition strength (9) and maximum steering utility (9) for safety applications."
