  "opposite_reasoning": "CompoundSubstance provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes because it represents a fundamental chemical distinction: atoms are elemental (cannot be decomposed into simpler substances by chemical means) while compounds are composed of multiple elements. This creates a clear, mutually exclusive binary that captures the essence of atomic simplicity vs molecular complexity. The opposition is stronger than Molecule (which is just one type of compound) and more chemically precise than the broader Organism concept. For concept steering, this axis would effectively distinguish between fundamental building blocks vs composite structures."
