  "opposite_reasoning": "Mystery provides the strongest semantic opposition to Explanation with high availability and confidence. It represents the fundamental opposite state: where explanation makes things understood and clear, mystery represents what is unexplained, unknown, or puzzling. This creates a clean conceptual axis for Fisher-LDA. While Obfuscation has higher steering utility for AI safety (being more intentional/deceptive), Mystery has better availability in SUMO and WordNet, and provides clearer semantic distance. The Explanation\u2194Mystery axis captures the fundamental dimension of 'degree of understanding' which is central to reasoning and communication."
