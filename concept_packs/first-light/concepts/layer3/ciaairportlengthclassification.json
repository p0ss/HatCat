  "opposite_reasoning": "CIAAirportLengthClassification is a highly specialized technical classification system without a natural semantic antonym. Since this concept is primarily useful for ontological completeness rather than AI safety applications (no deception/alignment relevance), the selection prioritizes maximum distributional distance. BiologicalAttribute provides strong categorical separation (engineered infrastructure vs. organic life) and is likely to exist in SUMO, making it practically available. The opposition strength (8/10) is the highest among candidates with reasonable availability. While this pairing has limited steering utility for AI safety (2/10), the concept itself is not safety-critical, so this is acceptable."
