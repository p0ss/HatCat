  "opposite_reasoning": "While BestMatchAlgorithm lacks a natural direct antonym, RandomSearchAlgorithm provides the strongest semantically meaningful opposition within the relevant domain. It captures the key distinguishing feature: optimization and relevance-based selection vs arbitrary/random selection. This opposition is more useful for Fisher-LDA steering than pure ontological opposites (Process vs Entity) because it maintains domain relevance while maximizing conceptual distance along the meaningful axis of 'search quality/optimization'. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between optimized vs random/arbitrary processes could be valuable for detecting degraded reasoning or intentional obfuscation. The concept should be added to layers as it represents a genuine algorithmic approach."
