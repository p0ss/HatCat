  "opposite_reasoning": "Solidification provides the strongest semantic opposition to GasMotion across multiple dimensions: (1) state opposition - gas (dispersed, free molecules) vs solid (fixed, condensed structure), (2) process opposition - motion/flow vs fixation/stabilization, (3) physical property opposition - compressible/expansive vs incompressible/rigid. While not a direct antonym, it represents a complementary physical process that maximally contrasts with gas motion. This provides a strong negative anchor for Fisher-LDA separation. Stasis was a close second but is more abstract and less specific to the material/physical nature of GasMotion."
