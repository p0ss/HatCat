  "opposite_reasoning": "Confronting is the strongest semantic opposite to Dodging because it captures the core behavioral opposition: avoidance vs. direct engagement. For Fisher-LDA, this provides maximum separation along a meaningful axis of evasion vs. engagement. This is particularly relevant for AI safety monitoring where detecting evasive vs. direct behaviors could be important (e.g., dodging questions vs. confronting issues directly). The concept represents a clear binary opposition in intentional movement patterns and engagement strategies."
