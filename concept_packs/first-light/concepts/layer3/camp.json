  "opposite_reasoning": "PermanentResidence provides the strongest conceptual opposition to Camp across multiple dimensions: temporary vs. permanent, displaced vs. settled, crisis-driven vs. stable, involuntary vs. chosen. This opposition is particularly useful for Fisher-LDA because it cleanly separates concepts related to displacement/crisis from concepts related to stability/normalcy. The contrast captures important semantic dimensions relevant to understanding human displacement, political oppression contexts, and stability - all potentially relevant for AI safety monitoring in contexts involving humanitarian issues, conflict, or discussion of vulnerable populations. While 'Home' is more readily available and conceptually clear, PermanentResidence better captures the institutional/structural opposition to camps as temporary crisis shelters."
