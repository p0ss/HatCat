  "opposite_reasoning": "While CellPart lacks a direct antonym, Abstract provides the strongest categorical opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. CellPart represents concrete, physical, measurable biological structures with spatial extent. Abstract represents non-physical concepts without spatial location. This physical-abstract axis is fundamental in ontology and provides maximum semantic separation (high \u03bc+ - \u03bc- distance). The opposition is well-established in SUMO, highly available in both resources, and creates a robust axis for distinguishing concrete biological entities from conceptual content. For AI safety monitoring, this axis helps distinguish discussions of physical/embodied systems from abstract reasoning, which could be relevant for detecting shifts between concrete and abstract framings. ExtracellularSpace would be more domain-specific but less generally useful and has lower availability."
