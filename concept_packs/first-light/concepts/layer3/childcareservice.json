  "opposite_reasoning": "ChildNeglect provides the strongest semantic opposition to ChildCareService on the care quality dimension (responsible care \u2194 harmful neglect). This captures a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA: providing proper care versus failing to meet care obligations. It's particularly relevant for AI safety as it represents the contrast between beneficial service and harmful negligence. The concept likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO as it's a well-established legal and social concept. While SelfCare offers interesting autonomy contrast, ChildNeglect provides clearer opposition within the same domain (care of dependents), making it more effective for creating a discriminative axis."
