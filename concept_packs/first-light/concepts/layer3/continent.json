  "opposite_reasoning": "Insular provides the strongest and most natural geographic complementary opposite to Continental. In geographic classification, landmasses are fundamentally divided into continental (large connected land masses) and insular (islands). This is a well-established taxonomic distinction that creates clear semantic opposition useful for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. While this has limited direct relevance to AI safety/deception detection, it provides a clean, interpretable axis for geographic attribute representation. The opposition is stronger than scalar alternatives (local/provincial) and more precisely complementary than oceanic/maritime which refer to water bodies rather than land classification types."
