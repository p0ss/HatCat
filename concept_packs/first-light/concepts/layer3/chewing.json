  "opposite_reasoning": "Swallowing is the strongest candidate because it represents a complementary process within the same functional domain (eating/digestion). While not a true antonym, it provides meaningful opposition: mechanical breakdown vs. transport, voluntary vs. involuntary, preparation vs. completion. This creates a coherent semantic axis within the eating process domain. The opposition is stronger than abstract category opposites (process vs. state) or distant distributional opposites (physical vs. mental), and it's highly likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies."
