  "opposite_reasoning": "Staring provides the strongest behavioral opposition to Blinking. While blinking is characterized by rapid, brief interruptions of vision through eyelid closure, staring represents sustained, uninterrupted eye opening with minimal or suppressed blinking. This creates a clear complementary axis: rapid periodic closure vs. sustained fixated opening. Both are voluntary eye-related processes at similar ontological levels, making them suitable for Fisher-LDA separation. Staring is well-established in both WordNet and likely in SUMO, and provides interpretable semantic distance."
