  "opposite_reasoning": "Curtain lacks a clear direct antonym. Among candidates, Floor provides the strongest geometric and functional opposition: vertical hanging element vs. horizontal supporting surface. Both are architectural elements, making them semantically related enough to be meaningful opposites, while differing fundamentally in orientation, function (covering/blocking vs. supporting), and spatial position (descends from above vs. base below). This opposition is more semantically coherent than Machine (too distant) or Window (too functionally coupled rather than opposed). For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clear axis within the architectural domain."
