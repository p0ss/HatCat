  "opposite_reasoning": "GunBreech provides the strongest semantic opposition as it represents the opposite end of the gun barrel (rear vs. front, input vs. output). This spatial and functional opposition creates clear separation in semantic space, making it ideal for Fisher-LDA axis construction. While AI safety utility is limited for this specific technical concept, the opposition is mathematically clean and defensible. GunMuzzle and GunBreech form a natural complementary pair within weapon ontology."
