  "opposite_reasoning": "Atlas (first cervical vertebra) provides the strongest anatomically meaningful opposition to Coccyx (terminal vertebrae). Both are parts of the vertebral column, making them taxonomically related yet maximally distant within that system (superior vs inferior extremes). This positional opposition (cranial/head end vs caudal/tail end) creates clear semantic separation suitable for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. While this opposition has minimal AI safety relevance, it's the most semantically coherent option for a highly specific anatomical term. Cranium was close alternative but Atlas is more precise as it's still part of the vertebral column."
