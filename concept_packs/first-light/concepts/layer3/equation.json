  "opposite_reasoning": "Inequality is the strongest semantic opposite for Equation. They represent complementary mathematical statement types: equations assert equality between expressions (=) while inequalities assert non-equality (<, >, \u2264, \u2265, \u2260). This is a natural partition in mathematical logic. Both concepts exist in formal mathematical ontologies and WordNet. For Fisher-LDA, this opposition captures the fundamental distinction between asserting equivalence versus asserting difference - a conceptually clean axis. While not directly relevant to deception/alignment safety, it provides a mathematically principled opposition that could be useful for distinguishing precise mathematical reasoning patterns."
