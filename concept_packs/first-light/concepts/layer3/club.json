  "opposite_reasoning": "Individual provides the strongest semantic opposition to Club along the collective\u2194singular dimension. This is a fundamental ontological distinction that creates a clear axis: formal groups with shared interests vs independent persons. The opposition is strong enough for Fisher-LDA (high separability), exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and captures an important distinction for AI safety monitoring (group dynamics vs individual agency, collective responsibility vs personal accountability). While Club doesn't have a traditional antonym, Individual represents the most meaningful complementary concept."
