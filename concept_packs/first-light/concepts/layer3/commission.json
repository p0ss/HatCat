  "opposite_reasoning": "While Commission lacks a direct antonym, Individual provides the strongest available opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. It captures the fundamental collective-institution vs. singular-person dimension, which is semantically robust and well-represented in both WordNet and SUMO. This opposition is useful for distinguishing organizational/institutional agency from personal agency - relevant for AI safety in understanding attribution and responsibility structures. PartisanOrganization would be stronger for the nonpartisan dimension but likely doesn't exist as a standard concept. Individual is the safest choice with high availability and reasonable opposition strength."
