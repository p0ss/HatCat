  "opposite_reasoning": "PublicInformation provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes. ComputerPassword represents deliberately secret, private information that controls access, while PublicInformation represents openly accessible data. This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring: distinguishing between private/confidential information (like passwords, credentials) versus public information is crucial for detecting potential security violations, credential exposure, or privacy breaches. The private\u2194public dimension is fundamental to the concept of passwords and provides clear semantic distance for concept steering."
