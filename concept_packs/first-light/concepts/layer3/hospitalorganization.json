  "opposite_reasoning": "HospitalOrganization lacks a direct institutional antonym, but the strongest semantic opposition lies in the functional purpose: hospitals serve the sick/injured, so the opposite concept is the state of health/wellness that makes hospital care unnecessary. This creates a meaningful Fisher-LDA axis from 'need for medical intervention' to 'state of health'. While not a perfect institutional opposite, it captures the most salient semantic contrast and has moderate AI safety utility for understanding health-related concepts. HealthyState is likely present in both WordNet and SUMO as a fundamental concept."
