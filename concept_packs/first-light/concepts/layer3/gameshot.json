  "opposite_reasoning": "GameShot represents a specific physical trajectory (ground-level, skimming motion). LobShot provides the clearest complementary opposite with a high-arcing trajectory through the air. This opposition captures the essential distinguishing feature (vertical spatial dimension) while remaining within the same ontological domain (sports actions/events). While this has limited direct relevance to AI safety concepts like deception, it provides strong semantic opposition for the Fisher-LDA axis, which is the primary requirement. The opposition is physical, measurable, and contextually appropriate to the sports domain where GameShot operates."
