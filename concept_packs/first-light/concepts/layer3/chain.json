  "opposite_reasoning": "Brake provides the strongest functional opposition for Fisher-LDA separation. While Chain and Brake are both bicycle components, they represent opposite functions: Chain transmits power TO create motion (propulsion), while Brake dissipates power to STOP motion (deceleration). This functional opposition (go vs. stop, energy transmission vs. energy dissipation) creates clear semantic distance useful for concept axis formation. The opposition is more meaningful than structural contrasts (Shaft, Belt) because it captures opposite purposes within the same system context. High availability in both WordNet and SUMO ensures robust implementation."
