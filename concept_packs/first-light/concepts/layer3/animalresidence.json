  "opposite_reasoning": "Wilderness provides the strongest semantic opposition for AnimalResidence along the domesticated/artificial vs. wild/natural dimension. This contrast captures the fundamental difference between human-constructed shelter for domesticated animals versus natural habitats. It has better opposition strength (7) than alternatives and should exist in both WordNet and SUMO. While this isn't directly relevant to AI safety/deception detection (hence moderate steering_utility), it provides a clear conceptual anchor for Fisher-LDA that distinguishes built shelter from natural environment. The artificial-vs-natural axis is semantically meaningful and well-represented in ontologies."
