  "opposite_reasoning": "FoodProduct provides the best balance of semantic opposition and practical availability. While BeverageProduct lacks a true antonym, FoodProduct represents the most natural complementary category within consumable goods. The beverage/food distinction is culturally universal, ontologically sound, and creates a useful axis for distinguishing liquid vs. solid consumables. This pairing is more semantically coherent than broader oppositions like DurableGood or Service, while being more specific and useful than abstract categories. Both concepts are well-established in WordNet and SUMO."
