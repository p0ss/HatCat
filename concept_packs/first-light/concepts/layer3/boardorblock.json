  "opposite_reasoning": "Fluid provides the strongest and most intuitive opposition to BoardOrBlock. The solid vs. fluid distinction is a fundamental physical state opposition that creates clear semantic distance. While this opposition has limited direct relevance to AI safety/deception detection, it provides strong geometric separation in concept space for Fisher-LDA. The opposition is well-established in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and represents a clear category boundary (rigid/shaped vs. flowing/shapeless). This is more principled than arbitrary distributional distance and leverages fundamental physical properties."
