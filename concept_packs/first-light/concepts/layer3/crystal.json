  "opposite_reasoning": "Amorphous is the strongest semantic opposite because it represents the fundamental structural distinction in material science: ordered vs disordered atomic/molecular arrangement. This is a scientifically grounded, mutually exclusive binary opposition that provides maximum separation in concept space for Fisher-LDA. While 'Liquid' and 'Gas' are also valid state-of-matter opposites, 'Amorphous' more directly opposes the defining characteristic of crystals (structural order) rather than just physical state. For AI safety steering, this clear structural binary (ordered/disordered) provides reliable conceptual anchoring."
