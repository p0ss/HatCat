  "opposite_reasoning": "Anarchy provides the strongest semantic opposition to Constitution for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. Constitution represents formalized governing principles and structured authority, while Anarchy represents their absence or rejection. This opposition is: (1) well-established in political philosophy, (2) likely to create distinct distributional patterns in embedding space, (3) conceptually clear and unambiguous, (4) available in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between principled governance frameworks and their absence could be relevant for detecting reasoning about social structures, institutional legitimacy, and rule-following behavior."
