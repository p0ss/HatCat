  "opposite_reasoning": "Waste provides the strongest semantic opposition to Fuel along multiple dimensions: (1) functional: input vs output in consumption processes, (2) utility: energy-bearing vs depleted, (3) temporal: before vs after transformation, (4) value: desirable resource vs unwanted byproduct. This opposition is particularly strong in the nuclear context (fresh fuel vs nuclear waste), aligns with the domain mentioned in the definition, and creates a meaningful axis for Fisher-LDA. The Fuel\u2192Waste transformation represents a fundamental process in energy systems, making this a natural complementary pair."
