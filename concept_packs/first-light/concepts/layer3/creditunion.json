  "opposite_reasoning": "InvestmentBank provides the strongest taxonomic opposition within the financial institution domain. Both are financial entities, but they represent fundamentally different operational philosophies: cooperative/member-owned vs. profit-driven, retail/community-focused vs. institutional/market-focused, democratically governed vs. shareholder-controlled. This opposition is semantically meaningful, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides clear conceptual separation useful for Fisher-LDA steering. The contrast captures important institutional differences relevant to understanding organizational alignment and purpose (member benefit vs. profit maximization), which has indirect relevance to AI safety concepts around aligned vs. misaligned objectives."
