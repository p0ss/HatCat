  "definition": "A &%GUICheckBox is a &%GUIActiveArea with associated text or\nicon that may have its state changed between selected and not selected by clicking or typing a keyboard key.\nSome applications use checkboxes that allow an indeterminate state in addition to the two provided by a\nnormal checkbox. This third state is depicted differently than the selected and unselected states, and\nindicates that its state is neither checked nor unchecked. This is most often used when the checkbox is\ntied to a collection of items in mixed states. The indeterminate state cannot usually be selected by the\nuser, and switches to a checked (or in some applications unchecked) state when activated.  Like a\n&%GUIRadioButton a &%GUICheckBox stays selected after being clicked on and released, but unlike a radio\nbutton, multiple check boxes in a set may be the selected state at the same time.",
