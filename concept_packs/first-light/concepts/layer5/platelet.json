  "definition": "Platelets, also called\nthrombocytes, are a\ncomponent of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors)\nis to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, thereby\ninitiating a blood clot. Platelets have no cell nucleus; they are\nfragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of\nthe bone marrow, which then enter the circulation. Circulating\ninactivated platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped)\nstructures,\u200a 2\u20133 \u00b5m in greatest diameter. Activated\nplatelets have cell membrane projections covering their surface.\nPlatelets are found only in &%Mammals, whereas in other vertebrates\n(e.g. &%Birds, amphibians), thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear\ncells.",
