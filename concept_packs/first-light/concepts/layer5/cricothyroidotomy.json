  "definition": "A cricothyrotomy (also called cricothyroidotomy) is an\nincision made through the &%Skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patient &%Airway during certain\nlife-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial\ntrauma. Cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where other means of tracheal\nintubation are impossible or impractical. Compared with tracheotomy, cricothyrotomy is quicker and easier\nto perform, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine, and is associated with fewer complications.\nHowever, while cricothyrotomy may be life saving in extreme circumstances, this technique is only intended\nto be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established.[from Wikipedia]",
