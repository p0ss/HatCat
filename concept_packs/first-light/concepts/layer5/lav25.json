  "definition": "LAV-25 (Light Armoured Vehicle) is an eight-wheeled\narmoured personnel carrier (APC) based on the Mowag Piranha family of\narmoured fighting vehicles used by the United States Marine Corps.\nPowered by a Detroit Diesel Turbo-Charged engine, they are 4 wheel drive\n(rear wheels) transferable to 8-wheel drive.  These vehicles are also\namphibious, meaning they have the ability to swim, but are limited to\nnon-surf bodies of water (No oceans).  While engaged in amphibious\noperations, the maximum speed is approximately 12 km/h.  Typical land\nspeeds are approximately 85 km/h in either 4 or 8-wheel drive, however\nfuel economy decreases in 8-wheel drive.  The vehicles operate on diesel\nfuel (JP-8), and require 3 weights of lubricants to remain in running\ncondition.  They are equipped with a M242 Bushmaster 25 mm cannon, two\nM240 7.62 mm machine guns, and 2 4-barrel launchers usually loaded with\nsmoke canisters.  The crew is three, and four passengers with combat gear.\nThe vehicle has been through many changes through the late 90s.  The new\nmodification or SLEP (Service Life Extension Program) has changed the\nLAV-25 to an LAV-25A1 standard.  (from Wikipedia)",
