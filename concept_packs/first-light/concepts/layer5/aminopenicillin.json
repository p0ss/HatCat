  "definition": "The aminopenicillins\nare a group of &%Antibiotics in the &%Penicillin family that are\nstructural analogs of ampicillin (which is the 2-amino derivative of\nbenzylpenicillin, hence the name). Like other penicillins and\nbeta-lactam antibiotics, they contain a beta-lactam ring that is\ncrucial to its antibacterial activity. Aminopenicillins feature a\npositively charged amino group that enhances their uptake through\nbacterial porin channels. This does not, however, prevent resistance\nconferred by bacterial beta-lactamases. Members of this family\ninclude ampicillin, amoxicillin and bacampicillin.[from Wikipedia]",
