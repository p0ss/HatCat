  "definition": "An Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) or\nAnti-Tank Guided Weapon (ATGW) is a guided missile primarily designed to\nhit and destroy heavily armored tanks and other armoured fighting\nvehicles.  ATGMs range in size from shoulder-launched weapons which can be\ntransported by a single soldier, to larger tripod mounted weapons which\nrequire a squad or team to transport and fire, to vehicle and aircraft\nmounted missile systems.  The introduction of smaller, man-portable ATGMs\nwith larger warheads to the modern battlefield has given infantry the\nability to defeat even heavily armored main battle tanks at great ranges,\nusually with the first shot.  Earlier infantry anti-tank weapons such as\nanti-tank rifles, anti-tank rockets and magnetic anti-tank mines had\nlimited armor-penetration abilities and/or required a soldier to approach\nthe target closely.
