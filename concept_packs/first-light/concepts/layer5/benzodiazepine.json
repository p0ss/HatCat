  "definition": "Benzodiazepines\n(BZD, BDZ, BZs), sometimes called 'benzos', are a class of\npsychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a\nbenzene ring and a diazepine ring. As depressants\u2014drugs which lower\nbrain activity\u2014they are prescribed to treat conditions such as\n&%Anxiety, &%Insomnia, and &%Seizures. The first benzodiazepine,\nchlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo\nSternbach in 1955 and was made available in 1960 by Hoffmann\u2013La Roche,\nwhich soon followed with diazepam (Valium) in 1963. By 1977,\nbenzodiazepines were the most prescribed medications globally; the\nintroduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), among\nother factors, decreased rates of prescription, but they remain\nfrequently used worldwide.[from Wikipedia]",
