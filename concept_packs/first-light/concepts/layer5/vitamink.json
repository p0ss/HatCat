  "definition": "Vitamin K refers to\nstructurally similar, fat-soluble vitamers found in foods and marketed\nas dietary supplements. The human body requires vitamin K for\npost-synthesis modification of certain proteins that are required for\nblood coagulation (K from koagulation, Danish for 'coagulation') or\nfor controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The\ncomplete synthesis involves final modification of these so-called 'Gla\nproteins' by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that uses vitamin K\nas a cofactor. The presence of uncarboxylated proteins indicates a\nvitamin K deficiency. Carboxylation allows them to bind (chelate)\ncalcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K,\nblood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding\noccurs. Research suggests that deficiency of vitamin K may also weaken\nbones, potentially contributing to osteoporosis, and may promote\ncalcification of arteries and other soft tissues.[from Wikipedia]",
