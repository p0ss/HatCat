  "definition": "A dune is a landform composed of &%Wind - or\n&%Water -driven &%Sand. It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or &%Hill.\nDunes are most common in &%Desert environments, where the lack of moisture hinders the growth of\nvegetation that would otherwise interfere with the development of dunes. However,\nsand deposits are not restricted to deserts, and dunes are also found along sea\n&%ShoreAreas, along &%SteamWaterAreas in semiarid climates, in areas of glacial outwash, and in\nother areas where poorly cemented sandstone bedrock disintegrates to produce an\nample supply of loose sand. Dunes are generally defined as greater than 7 cm tall [from Wikipedia].",
