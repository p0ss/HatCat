  "definition": "Bradycardia is a condition\ntypically defined wherein an individual has a resting heart rate of\nunder 60 beats per minute (BPM) in adults, although some studies use a\nheart rate of less than 50 BPM. Bradycardia typically does not\ncause symptoms until the rate drops below 40 bpm. When symptomatic, it\nmay cause fatigue, weakness, dizziness, sweating, and at very low\nrates, fainting. During sleep, a slow heartbeat with rates around\n40\u201350 BPM is common, and is considered normal.[citation needed] Highly\ntrained athletes may also have athletic heart syndrome, a very slow\nresting heart rate that occurs as a sport adaptation and helps prevent\ntachycardia during training. The term 'relative bradycardia' is\nused to refer to a heart rate that, although not actually below 60\nBPM, is still considered too slow for the individual's current medical\ncondition.
