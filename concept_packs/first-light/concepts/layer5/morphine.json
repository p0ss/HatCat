It can\nbe taken for both acute pain and chronic pain and is frequently used for pain from &%HeartAttack,\nkidney stones, and during labor. Its maximum effect is reached after about 20\nminutes when administered intravenously and 60 minutes when administered by &%Mouth, while the\nduration of its effect is 3\u20137 hours.[from Wikipedia]",
