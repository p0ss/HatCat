  "definition": "An analgesic drug, also called simply an analgesic,\npain reliever, or painkiller, is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve relief from\npain (that is, analgesia or pain management). Analgesics are conceptually distinct from\nanesthetics, which temporarily reduce, and in some instances eliminate, sensation, although\nanalgesia and anesthesia are neurophysiologically overlapping and thus various drugs have\nboth analgesic and anesthetic effects. Various analgesics, such as many NSAIDs, are available\nover the counter in most countries, whereas various others are prescription drugs owing to the\nsubstantial risks and high chances of overdose, misuse, and addiction in the absence of medical\nsupervision.
