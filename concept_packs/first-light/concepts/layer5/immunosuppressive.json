  "definition": "Immunosuppression is a\nreduction of the activation or efficacy of the immune system. Some\nportions of the immune system itself have immunosuppressive effects on\nother parts of the immune system, and immunosuppression may occur as\nan adverse reaction to treatment of other conditions. In\ngeneral, deliberately induced immunosuppression is performed to\nprevent the body from rejecting an organ transplant. Additionally,\nit is used for treating graft-versus-host disease after a bone marrow\ntransplant, or for the treatment of auto-immune diseases such as\nsystemic &%Lupus erythematosus, &%RheumatoidArthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's\nsyndrome, or &%CrohnsDisease. This is typically done using\nmedications, but may involve surgery (splenectomy), plasmapheresis, or\nradiation. A person who is undergoing immunosuppression, or whose\nimmune system is weak for some other reasons (chemotherapy or HIV), is\nsaid to be immunocompromised.[from Wikipedia]",
