  "definition": "A &%ThreeDPrinter is a &%ComputerOutputDevice \nfor the construction of a three-dimensional &%Object from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD)\nmodel or a digital 3D model. Three-dimensional models represent a physical body using\na collection of points in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as\ntriangles, lines, curved surface etc. In a 3D printing process, material is deposited, \njoined or solidified under computer control, with the material being added together \n(such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused), typically layer by layer.
