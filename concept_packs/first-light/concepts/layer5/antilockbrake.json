  "definition": "A &%VehicleBrake with an electronic component\nthat reduces the likelihood of locking up the wheels during a sudden stop.  If the\nwheels stop turning, the controller reduces pressure on the brakes until they begin\nturning again, then alternates application and reduction of braking pressure in short\nintervals.  The goal is to keep the wheels at as near as possible the point of \ntransition between dynamic or sliding friction and the point of static friction (at\nwhich the stopping force is greater).",
