  "definition": "Gram stain or Gram\nstaining, also called Gram's method, is a method of staining used to\ndistinguish and classify bacterial species (&%Bacterium) into two\nlarge groups: &%GramPositive bacteria and &%GramNegative bacteria.\nGram staining differentiates bacteria by the chemical and physical\nproperties of their cell walls. Gram-positive cells have a thick layer\nof peptidoglycan in the cell wall that retains the primary stain,\ncrystal violet. Gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer\nthat allows the crystal violet to wash out on addition of &%Ethanol.\nThey are stained pink or red by the counterstain commonly safranin or\nfuchsine. Lugol's iodine solution is always added after addition of\ncrystal violet to strengthen the bonds of the stain with the cell\nmembrane. [from Wikipedia]",
