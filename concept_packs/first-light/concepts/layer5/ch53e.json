  "definition": "Designated S-80E internally by the Sikorsky Aircraft\nCorporation, the Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion, and the Navy MH-53E\nSea Dragon are the largest and heaviest helicopters in the United States\nmilitary.  The base model CH-53E serves both the Navy and Marines in the\nheavy lift transport role.  It is capable of lifting heavy equipment\nincluding the 8 wheeled LAV-25 Light Armored Vehicle (but not the U.S.\nArmy Stryker, which is too heavy), the M198 155mm Howitzer with ammunition\nand crew, and can recover all other Marine corps aircraft except for the\nKC-130.  The less common MH-53E fills the Navy's need for long range mine\nsweeping or Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) missions.  It features\nenlarged side mounted fuel sponsons and is rigged for towing its mine\nsweeping sled from high above the dangerous naval mines.  Currently under\ndevelopment is the CH-53K, formerly known as the Heavy Lift Replacement,\nwhich will be equipped with three 6000 shp-class turboshaft engines.\n(from Wikipedia)",
