  "definition": "Vitamin D is a group of\nfat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal\nabsorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and many other\nbiological effects. In humans, the most important compounds in\nthis group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin\nD2 (ergocalciferol). The major natural source of the vitamin\nis synthesis of cholecalciferol in the lower layers of skin epidermis\nthrough a chemical reaction that is dependent on sun exposure\n(specifically UVB radiation). Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol\ncan be ingested from the diet and from supplements. Only a few\nfoods, such as the flesh of fatty fish, naturally contain significant\namounts of vitamin D. In the U.S. and other countries, cow's\nmilk and plant-derived milk substitutes are fortified with vitamin D,\nas are many breakfast cereals. Mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light\ncontribute useful amounts of vitamin D Dietary recommendations\ntypically assume that all of a person's vitamin D is taken by mouth,\nas sun exposure in the population is variable and recommendations\nabout the amount of sun exposure that is safe are uncertain in view of\nthe skin cancer risk.[from Wikipedia]",
