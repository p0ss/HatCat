Though the teeth are not straight_sided (but usually of special \nform to achieve a constant drive ratio, mainly involute but less commonly cycloidal), \nthe edge of each tooth is straight and aligned &%parallel to the &%axis of rotation. \nThese gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts.
