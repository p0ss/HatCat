  "definition": "Septoplasty\n or alternatively submucous septal resection and\nseptal reconstruction, is a corrective surgical procedure done to\nstraighten a deviated &%NasalSeptum \u2013 the nasal septum being the\npartition between the two &%NasalCavities. Ideally, the septum\nshould run down the center of the nose. When it deviates into one of\nthe cavities, it narrows that cavity and impedes airflow. Deviated\nnasal septum or 'crooked' internal nose can occur at childbirth or as\nthe result of an injury or other trauma. If the wall that functions as\na separator of both sides of the nose is tilted towards one side at a\ndegree greater than 50%, it might cause difficulty breathing. Often\nthe inferior turbinate on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed\ncompensatory hypertrophy. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal\nobstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, while\nthe recovery time could be up to several weeks. Put simply,\nseptoplasty is a surgery that helps repair the passageways in the nose\nmaking it easier to breathe. This surgery is usually performed on\npatients with a deviated septum, recurrent rhinitis, or ossinus\nissues. [from Wikipedia]",
