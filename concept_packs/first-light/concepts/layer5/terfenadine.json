  "definition": "Terfenadine is an\nantihistamine formerly used for the treatment of allergic conditions.\nIt was brought to market by Hoechst Marion Roussel (now\nSanofi-Aventis) and was marketed under various brand names, including\nSeldane in the United States, Triludan in the United Kingdom, and\nTeldane in Australia. It was superseded by fexofenadine in the\n1990s due to the risk of a particular type of disruption of the\nelectrical rhythms of the heart (specifically cardiac arrhythmia\ncaused by QT interval prolongation) and has been withdrawn from\nmarkets worldwide.[from Wikipedia]",
