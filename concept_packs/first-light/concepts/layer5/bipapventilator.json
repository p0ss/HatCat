  "definition": "A non-invasive\nventilator that provides breathing support administered through a face\nmask, nasal mask, or a helmet. Air, usually with added oxygen, is\ngiven through the mask under positive pressure; generally the amount\nof pressure is alternated depending on whether someone is breathing in\nor out. It is termed 'non-invasive' because it is delivered with a\nmask that is tightly fitted to the face or around the head, but\nwithout a need for tracheal &%Intubation (a tube through the mouth into\nthe windpipe). While there are similarities with regards to the\ninterface, NIV is not the same as a continuous positive airway pressure\n(&%CPAPVentilator), which applies a single level of positive airway pressure\nthroughout the whole respiratory cycle; CPAP does not deliver\nventilation but is occasionally used in conditions also treated with\nNIV. Non-invasive ventilation is used in acute respiratory failure\ncaused by a number of medical conditions, most prominently\n&%ChronicObstructivePulmonaryDisease (COPD). [from Wikipedia]",
