  "definition": "&%MountainBreeze is the most common form of\n&%katabaticWind due to radiative cooling. The slope surface cools down radiatively after \nsunset, which cools down the air near the slope. This cooler air layer then flows down in \nthe valley. This type of katabatic is very often observed during the night in the mountains,\nespecially during periods of light synoptic flow. In meteorology, a mountain breeze and a \nvalley breeze are two related, localized winds that occur one after the other on a daily cycle. \n[Wikipedia]",
