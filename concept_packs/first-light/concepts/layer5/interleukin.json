  "definition": "Interleukins (ILs) are a\ngroup of cytokines (secreted proteins and signal molecules) that were\nfirst seen to be expressed by white blood cells (leukocytes). ILs can\nbe divided into four major groups based on distinguishing structural\nfeatures. However, their amino acid sequence similarity is rather weak\n(typically 15\u201325% identity). The human genome encodes more than 50\ninterleukins and related proteins. The function of the immune\nsystem depends in a large part on interleukins, and rare deficiencies\nof a number of them have been described, all featuring autoimmune\ndiseases or immune deficiency. The majority of interleukins are\nsynthesized by helper CD4 T lymphocytes, as well as through monocytes,\nmacrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and\ndifferentiation of T and B lymphocytes, and hematopoietic cells. [from\nWikipedia]",
