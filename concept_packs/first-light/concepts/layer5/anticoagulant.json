Some of\nthem occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as &%Leeches and\n&%Mosquitoes, where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough\nfor the animal to obtain some blood. As a class of medications,\nanticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders. Oral\nanticoagulants (OACs) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form,\nand various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in\n&%HospitalOrganizations.
