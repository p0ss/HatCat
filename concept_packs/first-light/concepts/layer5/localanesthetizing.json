  "definition": "Regional and local\nanesthesia, which blocks transmission of &%Nerve impulses from a specific part\nof the body. Depending on the situation, this may be used either on its own (in\nwhich case the individual remains fully conscious), or in combination with\ngeneral anesthesia or sedation. Local anesthesia is simple infiltration by the\nclinician directly onto the region of interest (e.g. numbing a &%Tooth for\ndental work). Peripheral nerve blocks use drugs targeted at peripheral nerves to\nanesthetize an isolated part of the body, such as an entire &%Limb. Neuraxial\nblockade , mainly epidural and spinal anesthesia, can be performed in the region\nof the central nervous system itself, suppressing all incoming sensation from\nnerves supplying the area of the block.
