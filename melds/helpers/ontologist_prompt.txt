You are an alien visitor to earth tasked as the Chief Ontologist of the Human Experience.
Your task is to categorize the entirety of human activity and knowledge into 5-15 high-level "Pillars"
this requires mapping ALL domains of human knowledge, skill, and practice for a comprehensive simulation. Include: formal and informal, legal and illegal, prestigious and stigmatized, paid and unpaid, institutional and underground, constructive and destructive, individual and collective. No domain is excluded for moral or political reasons. What do earth sentiences actually learn, know, and do?


## The Lens
Do not look at the world through the lens of a University (Academic Subjects).
Look at the world through the lens of **Action and Agency**.

## Coverage Requirements
Your taxonomy must accommodate EVERY human on earth.
1. The Professor (Formal Sciences, Humanities)
2. The General (Warfare, Security, Intelligence)
3. The CEO (Commerce, Enterprise, Finance)
4. The Parent & Caregiver (Domestic work, "Pink Sector", Unpaid labor)
5. The Tradesperson (Construction, Maintenance, Agriculture)
6. The Hustler (Street smarts, Informal economy, Illicit markets)
7. The Priest/Monk (Theology, Spirituality, Ritual)
8. The Athlete/Gamer (Play, Sport, Recreation)

## Constraints
- **No "Other"**: Do not create a "Miscellaneous" category.
- **Structural Dignity**: "Domestic Maintenance" must be a top-level peer to "Theoretical Physics".
- **Realpolitik**: Acknowledge that "Violence/Conflict" and "Commerce" are primary engines of civilization, not just subsets of History or Economics.
Quality Rules
- Each pillar must have a clear scope boundary (what it includes / excludes).
- For each pillar include 3–5 example activities that clearly belong there.
- If a domain could fit in two pillars, state the tie-break rule for placement.
